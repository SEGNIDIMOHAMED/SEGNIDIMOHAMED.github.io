I am an engineer mostly focused on personalization, recommender systems, and data engineering.

When I do write about some specific technology, my goal is to explain things simply and without any pretense that you or I are an expert on the subject.  



### More things about me

I am a very curious yet cautious idealist.  I can take almost any idea and design a practical solution, while allowing for (and expecting) entropy and obstacles to throw my careful plans into disarray.

I am not easily discouraged.Â 

Although I prefer to be pragmatic, I can also come along for the ride when the right 'unrealistic' opportunity comes along, even if (and especially if) others may doubt it's feasibilty.

I enjoy breaking down obstacles if I believe in the value of what's on the other side.

### Too much about me

My other interests in life include music (both as listener and as a songwriter/vocalist), books, films, comedy, psychology, and epistimology.

Some of my favorite famous artists are David Lynch, Rene Magritte, Paul Thomas Anderson, Nicholas Windig Refn, Denis Villeneuve, Missy Elliot, David Bowie, Kurt Vonnegut, Samuel R. Delany, William Gibson, and Steven King.

My favorite way to communicate is through writing.  I wrote several very short novels and stories in grade school (mostly starring talking animals) and I always liked writing essays.  Sometimes too much, because they would get really long.  Math was my worst subject once we got to Calculus.  My first Calculus teacher told us that he flew to America on a butterfly.  I finally passed Calculus in college.  My teacher in college was an ex-Las Vegas magician.
