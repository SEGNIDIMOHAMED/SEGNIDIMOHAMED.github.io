I am a software engineer, algorithm developer, and system architect who currently 
works in the field of medical imaging. I have a PhD in biomedical physics and an active 
interest in systems programming, programming languages, math, and optics. The blog posts are my 
_personal_ notes, while exploring the subjects I am interested in. It is me explaining
to myself as I learn, hoping that other people can learn from it, too.
