## Hi, I'm Scott Rippey! 

I live in Boise, Idaho, with my awesome wife and 5 kids.  We like to ride bikes, play baseball, and generally just be together!  We love Jesus and are raising our kids to follow Him too.


## What I do

I'm a full-stack engineer with a passion for front-end development.  I love the art of writing code and seeing it come to life as a beautiful UI.  
I take pride in writing code that's clean, understandable, testable, and reusable.  Hopefully my Github profile showcases my passion!  


## My Projects

I have a couple of [interesting GitHub projects](./my-projects), so please take a look!
