![local AI is awesome](/images/ComfyUI_02828_.png "Local ai is awesome!")

In the twenties, working on local-ai systems.

Recently, I took the initiative to build my own Frankenstein deep learning rig that runs a few models (LLM, TTS, STT, IMAGES, etc.).
I used a second-hand Dell Poweredge server (100$). A fair amount of 3D print and a risers for the 3090's GPUs.

It's really fun how to interact with a local AI suite.
I am deploying AI microservices for a local AI suite that deal with a diverse range of tasks with a focus on availability, a key for a go-to solution.
Soon enough I'll post some resources on how to build a complete AI-suite that have Text, Images, Video, Voice (TTS, STT), and real-time capabilities.
