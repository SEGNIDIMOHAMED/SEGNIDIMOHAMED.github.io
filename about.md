My name is Shaked Delarea and I'm a Cyber Security Researcher.

In the past two years I was doing hardware security research on embedded devices
in Ben Gurion University at the [Hardware Implementation Lab of Dr. Yossi Oren.](https://orenlab.sise.bgu.ac.il/Publications)
My research focused on VCC and EM fault injection attacks and finding
vulnerabilities in hardware, as well as various methods of side channel attacks
specifically aimed towards hardware.


I worked as a Lecturer in the Java and Android Development at [iNT College](https://www.int-college.co.il/), the classes took place in English.

I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science and Information Systems Engineering in the Cyber Security
track of Ben Gurion University, as well as a B.Sc. in Computer Science from Sapir which I graduated with honorary distinction.
