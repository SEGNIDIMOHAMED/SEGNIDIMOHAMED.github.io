I am an engineer mostly focused on personalization, recommender systems, and data engineering.

When I do write about some specific technology, my goal is to explain things simply and without any pretense that you or I are an expert on the subject.  

My belief that motivates this approach, presented as a very rough and 'under construction' summary of many rambling thoughts: 

As we launch ourselves toward even more complexity and constant change, software engineers are needing less and less to become specialized experts in any one thing, and needing more to become constant learners, pattern recognizers, and analogy generators.  I think we'll need to get more comfortable with borrowing and modifying tools and ideas, versus trying to be totally original or disruptive or building from the ground up.

I also think it's helpful to think more abstractly and broadly about technology, rather than restricting it to our own area of expertise, and our narrow slice of history: thinking of what we do as science, as art, and as something that has existed as long as humans have been solving their problems with sharp sticks and rocks.  Today, our sticks and rocks are questions, evidence, and critical thinking.  Our creativity and human nature is our fire - both barely containable, yet powerful forces for both good and bad, depending on their application.  These things are unchanging, and never obsolete.

So while I do enjoy going deep on some juicy subjects, I don't think that it's necessary or wise to try to be an expert on everything I touch.  But I do think it's necessary to challenge myself often, and to constantly push the limits of my knowledge + expertise.


### More things about me

I am a very curious yet cautious idealist.  I can take almost any idea and design a practical solution, while allowing for (and expecting) entropy and obstacles to throw my careful plans into disarray.

I am not easily discouraged.Â 

Although I prefer to be pragmatic, I can also come along for the ride when the right 'unrealistic' opportunity comes along, even if (and especially if) others may doubt it's feasibilty.

I enjoy breaking down obstacles if I believe in the value of what's on the other side.

### Too much about me

My other interests in life include music (both as listener and as a songwriter/vocalist), books, films, comedy, psychology, and epistimology.

Some of my favorite famous artists are David Lynch, Rene Magritte, Paul Thomas Anderson, Nicholas Windig Refn, Denis Villeneuve, Missy Elliot, David Bowie, Kurt Vonnegut, Samuel R. Delany, William Gibson, and Steven King.

My favorite way to communicate is through writing.  I wrote several very short novels and stories in grade school (mostly starring talking animals) and I always liked writing essays.  Sometimes too much, because they would get really long.  Math was my worst subject once we got to Calculus.  My first Calculus teacher told us that he flew to America on a butterfly.  I finally passed Calculus in college.  My teacher in college was an ex-Las Vegas magician.
