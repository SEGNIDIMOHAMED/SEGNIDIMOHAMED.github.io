I am a software developer in the AI field since 4 years I was using the good-old davinci-002. Text generation as so much usefull things to deliver that I also build my own deep learning rig. Accessible to my little familly it has been a lot of fun !

I want to contribute to develop the open source community and mindset for AI system as big corporations do not share our humble ambitions of freedom and funny things to use without ads and tracking.
