Hi! I’m David. I’m a senior backend engineer at Vevo in Portland, OR. We build most of our services in Kotlin,
so I'm most fluent in that. I also am fairly fluent in Java, Python, and JavaScript. 
I've been working in tech for a little over 10 years.

Outside of work, I'm an avid photographer, trail runner, traveler, drone flier, and backpacker.

I'm perpetually curious and dig science. You can usually find me reading some kind of 
sciencey nonfiction book in my downtime, and I've been a longtime listener of the 
[Skeptic's Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/).

Despite working in tech and tending to be an enthusiastic early adopter of new devices and apps,
I try to maintain a healthy dose of skepticism and objectivity around it. 
I've never owned crypto, I think (in the near term, at least) that AI will be evolutionary and not revolutionary,
and I [deleted most of my social media profiles in 2019](/2019/06/15/digital-minimalism-review/). I draw a lot of my views on tech and society 
from people like [Cal Newport](https://calnewport.com/), [Steven Johnson](https://stevenberlinjohnson.com/), and [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/).

I’m also the second* [coolest guy in America](https://www.coolestguyinamerica.com/){:target="_blank"} (according to
Google). * I used to be the first coolest, but some random Internet guy who was better at SEO recently unseated me.
