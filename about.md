Hi. I’m David Merrick. I’m a software quality engineer in Portland, OR.

In my free time, I shoot photos, fly drones, run, and hike. 
I’m also the [coolest guy in America](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ0vbi_N3PAhVkwFQKHd8aCsUQPAgD#hl=en&q=coolest+guy+in+america){:target="_blank"} (according to Google).
