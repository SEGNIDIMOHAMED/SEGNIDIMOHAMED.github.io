![local ai is great](/images/ComfyUI_02828_.png "Local ai is awesome!")

**About me**

I'm in my twenties, and had the privilege of working with early beta access of openai in 2020 and the impressive Davinci-002. 
Since then, the possibilities that text generation and other AI applications developed became tremendous.

Recently, I took the initiative to build my own deep learning rig. I spent so much time and efforts into it that I feel quite ready to help other do the same.

I am creating a way to interact with a local AI in the simplest way for a diversity of tasks.
Soon enough I'll post some ressources on how to build a complete AI-suite that have Text, Images, Video, Voice (TTS, STT), and real-time capabilities.

**Open-Source in AI is awesome !**

I believe in the power of open-source communities and their potential to drive innovation without being bound by corporate interests. Unlike big corporations, our humble ambitions are rooted in freedom, creativity, and the desire for ad-free and tracking-free experiences.

Contributing to the development of open-source AI systems that put users first is so much fun and rewarding !
