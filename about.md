![local AI is awesome](/images/ComfyUI_02828_.png "Local ai is awesome!")

In the twenties, working on local-ai systems.

Recently, I took the initiative to build my own Frankenstein deep learning rig that runs Llama3-70B Q6 on a second-hand Dell Poweredge server. A fair amount of 3D print and a little Dremmel to expose server brain to my 4x3090 GPUs.

It's really fun how much you can develop a sense of affection for this talky thing.

I spent so much time and efforts into it that I feel quite ready to help other do the same.

I am creating a way to interact with a local AI in the simplest way for a diverse range of tasks.
Soon enough I'll post some resources on how to build a complete AI-suite that have Text, Images, Video, Voice (TTS, STT), and real-time capabilities.
