Seasoned, hands‑on Software Architect—30 years turning complex cloud and NoSQL challenges into elegant, AI‑driven solutions that power the future.

### More Information

With almost three decades shaping the software landscape, I’m a hands‑on Software Architect who thrives on translating ambitious ideas into resilient, cloud‑native products. My journey spans life‑critical medical devices, enterprise information systems, early handhelds and mobile phones, high‑performance networking gear, and—most recently—Redis’s cloud NoSQL platform. I excel at exposing hidden requirements, crafting scalable architectures, and guiding teams from whiteboard sketches to production code. Equally comfortable diving into C/C++, Go, or Rust as I am mentoring engineers, I relish untangling complex design snarls and optimizing for performance, reliability, and cost. Energized by the latest breakthroughs in AI/ML, I continuously infuse intelligent capabilities into modern data services—positioning organizations to innovate faster, operate smarter, and deliver lasting value to customers.
