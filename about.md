Hi. I’m David Merrick. I’m a software engineer in Portland, OR.

![]({{site.cdn_path}}/2017/08/23/crazy_party.jpg)

In my free time, I'm an avid photographer, trail runner, drone flier, and backpacker. 
I’m also the [coolest guy in America](https://www.google.com/webhp?hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ0vbi_N3PAhVkwFQKHd8aCsUQPAgD#hl=en&q=coolest+guy+in+america){:target="_blank"} (according to Google).

You can find some of my photography here: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/42873456@N02/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42873456@N02/).

And my drone videos/projects/etc on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkH0bhU7_RvRbe2uqyFjAcg).

## About this site

I put a lot of thought into the architecture of this site. If you're curious about how I built it, please read [this post](/2017/05/24/about-this-site/).
