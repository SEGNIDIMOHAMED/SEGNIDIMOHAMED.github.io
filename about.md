Hi! I’m David. I’m a backend Java/Kotlin developer at Vevo in Portland, OR.

I'm an avid photographer, trail runner, traveler, drone flier, and backpacker.

I'm perpetually curious and dig science. You can usually find me reading some kind of 
sciencey nonfiction book in my downtime, and I've been a longtime listener of the 
[Skeptic's Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/).

I’m also the second* [coolest guy in America](https://www.coolestguyinamerica.com/){:target="_blank"} (according to
Google). * I used to be the first coolest, but some random Internet guy who was better at SEO recently unseated me.
