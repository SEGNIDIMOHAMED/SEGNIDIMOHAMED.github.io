Please [register your intent](https://www.meetup.com/MicroPython-Meetup/) if you'd like to come along - it helps with planning. 

The meetup is a casual evening - absolute newbies are always welcome! - where you can ask questions, work on a project, listen to folks present on topics or just eat pizza. Mmmm pizza.
