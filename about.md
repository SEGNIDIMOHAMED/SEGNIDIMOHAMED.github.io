My name is Ben Watson, and I am an independent senior big data consultant, providing big data solutions to companies around the South East of England. I spend most of my time engineering with Java, Hadoop and the other major tools associated with it.

In my spare time I enjoy gradually getting worse at basketball and the guitar.
