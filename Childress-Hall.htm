			<p>The sand dunes in West Texas from the <a href='https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/monahans-sandhills' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Monahans Sandhills State Park</a> to Wichita Falls are a type of barchan dune. Barchan dunes are crescent-shaped dunes that are formed by winds that blow in one direction.  The wind blows the sand grains upwind depositing on the downwind side of the dune. The dune is constantly moving with the tips of the crescent moving forward.</p><p>The sand dunes in West Texas are made up of quartz sand which is a hard, durable type of sand.  Quartz sand was originally deposited by rivers that flowed through the area millions of years ago.  Sand was picked up by the wind and blown into dunes.  Some other geological features of the sand dunes in West Texas to note are Transverse dunes which are aligned perpendicular to the prevailing wind direction.  They are the most common type of dune in the area.  Parabolic dunes are U-shaped and have a blowout in the middle which are formed by winds that blow in two directions.  Star dunes have multiple arms formed by winds that blow from different directions.</p>
			<p>Spring and autumn are pleasant seasons to visit Childress. The weather is mild with a moderate amount of precipitation.  Spring and autumn temperatures in Childress are relatively mild.  Average high temperature in the spring is 84°F versus the average high temperature in the autumn being 79°F.

The golf courses will attract visitors from all over the world to Childress and will help boost the local economy.</p>
