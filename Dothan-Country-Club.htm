        <h1>Dothan Country Club - Renovation by Billy Fuller Design</h1>
		<p>The renovation at <a href='https://www.dothancountryclub.com/about' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Dothan Country Club</a> is a comprehensive one, with Billy Fuller Golf Design making changes to almost every aspect of the course.  Dothan CC was founded in 1923.  Some of the key changes include rebuilding the bunkers completely to to be more challenging and strategic in their positioning.  Fuller believes that the new design will make them more interesting to play from tee to green.  The plan also will update the sub-surface drainage system with new pipes and culverts being installed to channel water from precipitation.  This will help to prevent flooding on the course and will make the course more playable in wet weather.  The greens on the course are also being completely rebuilt.  Fuller indicated that he wants the greens to be faster and more undulating with new challenges.  In addition to these major changes, Fuller is also making a number of smaller changes to the course such as adding new tees. Expectations are for the course more playable for all levels of golfers.</p>
		<p>The renovation is expected to be completed in late 2023. The Future Masters junior golf tournament will be return to Dothan in 2024.  Project is budgeted at $2 million with a total closure of no tee times during the year the course is being renovated.</p>
