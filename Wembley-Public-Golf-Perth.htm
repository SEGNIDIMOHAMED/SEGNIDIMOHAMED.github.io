				<p><a href='https://www.wembleygolf.com.au/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Wembley Golf Course</a> is a public golf facility located in Wembley Downs, Perth in Western Australia. In a joint announcement, <a href='https://www.facebook.com/krusegolf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Harley Kruse</a> and the <a href='https://www.cdpgolf.com' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Clayton Devries Pont</a> firm were named as long term Masterplan consulting architects.</p>
				<p>The Old Course is a par 72 course featuring fairways in between native Tuart and Banksia trees that was designed by Graham Marsh opening in 2005. The Tuart Course is a more forgiving par 70 course that was designed by <a href='https://www.ausgolf.com.au/a-game-of-chance-by-peter-thomson' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Peter Thomson</a> opening in 2009.  Both courses have 3 sets of tees.  <p><a href='https://www.golf.org.au/wembley-golf-complex/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Golf Australia</a> has the Old Course for men's rating from the back tees has a Scratch rating of 70 and slope 118.  The Old Course for women's rating from the back tees has a Scratch rating of 74 and slope 123. The facility is Australia's busiest golf course hosting well over 100,000 rounds per year.

				<p>The soil type in Perth, Australia is generally sandy.  Situated on an extensive sand plain covered in sedimentary material, sand content of the soil can vary but is typically between 70% and 90%.  The soil generally lacks organic matter and drains quickly.  Perth generally has good air quality due to its coastal location and prevailing winds.  The average air quality index in Perth, Australia is 8.</p>
				<p>Perth has experienced water issues during the <a href='https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/river-murray/dry-conditions/millennium-drought' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Millennium Drought</a> which lasted from the late 1990s to the early 2000s. To address scarcity, Perth has invested in several measures to ensure a more reliable water supply, namely wastewater recycling, desalination plants along the coastline to convert seawater into drinking water, groundwater management of water conservation.</p>
				<p>Rainouts on the golf course are infrequent - Perth has a temperate Mediterranean climate characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters.
