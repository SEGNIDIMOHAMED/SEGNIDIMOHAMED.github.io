			<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://cabotcitrusfarms.com/golf/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Cabot Citrus Farms</a> will have two full 18 hole golf courses(Karoo, The Roost) and two short courses(The Squeeze, The Wedge).  The property is located in Brooksville, Florida. Karoo was designed by <a style='font-weight:bold' href='http://www.kylefranzgolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Kyle Franz</a>.  Additional golf courses were a collaboration among Franz, <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.mnuzzo.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mike Nuzzo</a> with input from <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://golfclubatlas.com/author/ran/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ran Morrissett</a> as Golf Course Architecture Advisor.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.greenscapemethods.com/don-mahaffey' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Don Mahaffey from Greenscape Methods</a> is leading golf course construction.  The course opens for play at the end of 2023. The new course is located on the former footprint of Rolling Oaks, one of the two courses at World Woods Golf Club.  Blessed by sandy soil, the golf is intended as a bouncy course that features broad fairways, flowering dogwood trees, and groves of moss-draped live oaks.</p>
			<p>The course also will feature 50-foot elevation changes across the property. Play will feature elements inspired by Golden Age architecture philosophy.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://harriskalinka.com/work/cabot-oaks/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Harris Kalinka</a> created the overhead video as an inspiring flyover over the sandy Cabot Citrus property.  Maintenance will be a critical factor in retaining firm conditions in different seasons in the Florida climate.</p>
			<p>Temperatures at Cabot Citrus Farms are relatively mild. Warmest months are June thru August. The coolest months are January thru February.  Average humidity in July is 75%.  Annual precipitation is 54 inches with the dampest months in summer.</p>
  			<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/realestate/ben-cowan-dewar-golf-developer.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ben Cowan-Dewar</a>, the golf course developer of Cabot Citrus Farms, has an admirable record of building properties that are aesthetically pleasing and commercially successful. Cowan-Dewar's company Cabot has developed courses in Canada, St. Lucia, United States.  Cowan-Dewar believes that golf courses should be integrated into their natural surroundings.  He has a successful record hiring golf architects focused on natural design practices for walking courses with follow on maintenance practices from golf course superintendents to keep turfgrass playing consistent and firm.</p>
