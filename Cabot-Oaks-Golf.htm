			<p><a href='https://cabotcitrusfarms.com/golf/oaks' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Cabot Oaks</a> is an 18 hole golf course located in Brooksville, Florida. It was designed by <a href='http://www.kylefranzgolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Kyle Franz</a> and <a href='https://www.mnuzzo.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mike Nuzzo</a> with <a href='https://golfclubatlas.com/author/ran/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ran Morrissett</a> as Golf Course Architecture Advisor.  The course opens for play in 2023. The new course is located on the former footprint of Rolling Oaks, one of the two courses at World Woods Golf Club.  Blessed by sandy soil, Cabot Oaks is intended as a bouncy course that features broad fairways, flowering dogwood trees, and groves of moss-draped live oaks.</p>
			<p>The course also will feature 50-foot elevation changes across the property. Play will feature elements inspired by Golden Age design philosophy.  Fairways at Cabot Oaks will be forgivingly wide which allows golfers to hit approach shots from a variety of angles into different hole locations on the greens. <a href='https://harriskalinka.com/work/cabot-oaks/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Harris Kalinka</a> created the overhead video as an inspiring flyover over the sandy Cabot Oaks course.  Maintenance will be a critical factor in retaining firm conditions in different seasons in the Florida climate.</p>
			<p><a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/realestate/ben-cowan-dewar-golf-developer.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ben Cowan-Dewar</a>, the golf course developer of Cabot Citrus Farms, has an admirable record in business by creating courses that are both aesthetically pleasing and commercially successful. Cowan-Dewar's company Cabot has developed courses in Canada, St. Lucia, and the United States.  Cowan-Dewar believes that golf courses should be integrated into their natural surroundings.  He has a successful record hiring the finest golf architects and then using golf course superintendent maintenance techniques to keep the turfgrass playing consistent and firm.</p>
