How to test anything:

1. **Capture** what you know so far and build a model
2. **Review** the model with others, identify what is important
3. **Explore** by running experiments to learn what you don't know
4. **Update** the model based on what you know now
5. **Repeat** this cycle until you stop finding useful information
