## Excellent strategy vs Just do it

It can be a daunting task to create an automation strategy, get resources signed off, heir or train automation engineers.

But what is the alternative, and is it a good idea?

"Just do it!"

### What might this look like?

* Making use of personal development time, or putting in some extra hours and learning to do some automation yourself (regardless if your day job is developing or testing)
* Having some kind of informal agreement either your manager or the projects manager. This might be along the lines of "give me a little time, I'll put in a little time".
* You might not see the benefit in this project/sprint, and setting expectations is important.

### What are the benefits of this?

* Personal development, over time you will gain confidence and be able to contribute some valuable automation
* If things go well, you may be able to gain some value sooner then you would think
* Build momentum by having something to show now, instead of a plan on what you will commit to later
* If you can prove the concept, it might be easier to get sign off for more resource to be spent on future automation projects

### What are the disadvantages?

* Without proper resources, there is a high risk of running out of time to deliver anything useful before the current sprint/project is finished
* If things go badly, it might turn people off to investing properly in future automation
* Automation is code, so you can easily build technical debt by treating it as a side project

## What if you want to develop your automation skills without trying them out on a customers project?

Fortunately for this, there are two great options:

1. Use one of the fantastic resources for practice testing such as

2. Contribute tests to an open source project
