July 2012, now a little over ten years ago I started as a Software Test Engineer at Citrix Systems, in the model village of Cambourne in Cambridgeshire, UK.

Since then, I've had the pleasure of testing a lot of great software, covering a huge range of technologies and business domains.

This summer, [I invited you to ask me anything](https://twitter.com/FullSnackTester/status/1543175591582732288), and you did!

I didn't answer those questions at the time, and then [I asked you to AMA again](https://twitter.com/FullSnackTester/status/1547878296276201475), and that time I answered directly on Twitter.

So, finally, after months of delay, here are my responses to your original questions.

## Question 1

> Question: _Have you ever felt the urge to move out of testing?_

Answer: Yes. I've been tempted a few times to focus on a more hands-on developer role, or a more product focused Product Owner type role. Fun fact, I also once applied for a role as a Scrum Master, but didn't even get an interview.

The main reason for considering these alternative roles, in both directions, is to be able to more directly influence positive outcomes for users, while still supporting and promoting testing and quality.

For now, I can satisfy both of these desires by pushing the boundaries of my role as a Quality Engineer.

> Question: Do you think you'll still be testing in 10 years from now?

Will I still be testing software? Yes, 100%. Will my role still be "Software Tester"? I doubt it, and in some ways it never has, but always will be.

See my post [When is a Tester not a Tester?](https://www.dowen.me.uk/when-is-a-tester-not-a-tester/)

> Question: What's been your biggest "high" in testing in your 10 year career so far?

Winner a "Make it happen" award for my work on Customer Empathy at Citrix was a pretty huge high! Putting engineers in front of real customers was a thrill.

A major highlight of that journey was supporting a customer who I had brought into the office, to do a presentation at a Citrix user group reflecting back their experience, and encouraging others to get involved.

> Question: What did you do before being a tester, and how has it helped you in testing?

Directly before being a Tester, I completed a degree at University in "Forensic and Security Technologies". There are so many things from my time at university that help me in Testing.

A 3 highlights include:

* My year as an elected officer in the students union, that taught me about advocacy and representation
* My modules on Business Analysis and Design, where I learned about gathering and analysing requirements
* Principles of forensic computing, where I learned about the concept of documenting things in a way that another competent person can reproduce my work

Going way back to college, when I was interning in the IT Department, one very big lesson that has helped me in my whole career in technology, especially testing, is this one thing:

_"Computers don't have problems, people have problems. When solving a problem, remember to think about the person before you think about the computer." - L. Coxall_

> Question: What piece of advice would have saved you the most heartache, had you known it earlier in your career?

Answer: I am technical, and when developers called me non-technical, what they might really meant was "I don't want to be challenged about this bit, because I'm not confident about it myself".
