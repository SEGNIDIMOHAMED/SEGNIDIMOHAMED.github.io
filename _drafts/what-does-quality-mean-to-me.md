There are many definitions of Software and Product "Quality". For a long time, earlier in my career, I did much to ignore the topic and felt it was intangible. The definitions that I had at the time were all about only the Correctness, the strict conformance to well specified requirements.

Over the last 3+ years I've massively increased my external communication with the wider testing community. I've read blogs, watched presentations and I've tested a bunch more software.

Now, I'm approaching a point I've got some kind of grasp of software quality, in a way that can be usefully and concisely defined.

### My definition doesn't exist in isolation

In order to come to this definition, I've spoke to, read and consumed from many great Testers. Notability [Dan Ashby](https://twitter.com/DanAshby04), whom I am now lucky enough to work with, and [Stu C](https://twitter.com/StooCrock).

I also took part in a [Quality Panel](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-ministry-of-testing-podcast-2021/lessons/mot-podcast-quality-panel) discussion for the MoT Podcast, alongside [Gem Hill](https://twitter.com/Gem_Hill), Alsa Tabatabei and [Lee Marshall]().

### Then, I posted this one Twitter:

> What does quality mean to me? Goodness, Usefulness and Correctness at a point of time, with a context that takes into account ethics, customer success, business success, competitor products and the wider industry. That allows for "good enough" in that context to be enough!
