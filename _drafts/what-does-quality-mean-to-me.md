There are many definitions of Software and Product "Quality". For a long time, earlier in my career, I did much to ignore the topic and felt it was intangible. The definitions that I had at the time were all about only the Correctness, the strict conformance to well specified requirements.

Over the last 3+ years I've massively increased my external communication with the wider testing community. I've read blogs, watched presentations and I've tested a bunch more software.

Now, I'm approaching a point I've got some kind of grasp of software quality, in a way that can be usefully and concisely defined.

I recently posted on Twitter:

> What does quality mean to me?
> Goodness, Usefulness and Correctness at a point of time, with a context that takes into account ethics, customer success, business success, competitor products and the wider industry. That allows for "good enough" in that context to be enough!
