<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What does quality mean to me?<br><br>Goodness, Usefulness and Correctness at a point of time, with a context that takes into account ethics, customer success, business success, competitor products and the wider industry. That allows for &quot;good enough&quot; in that context to be enough!</p>&mdash; The Full Snack Tester (Ben Dowen) (@FullSnackTester) <a href="https://twitter.com/FullSnackTester/status/1451238858817945601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
