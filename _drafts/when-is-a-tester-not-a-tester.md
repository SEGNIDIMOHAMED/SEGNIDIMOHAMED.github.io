There are many competing thoughts on Software Testing and especially the roles we take on for those of us, as I do, who define as Software Testers.

How much is too much?  Are there any boundaries, and should they exist? If Testing is an activity, and Quality is a whole team responsibility, who are the Testers?

I'm going to indulge in discussing some thoughts and asking some questions. What I won't do is give definitive answers, because as it should be, your context will be different to mine.

## Agile Teams

For the approximately the first two years of my career I worked in an independent Test team, working on a Waterfall project. All work was estimated, and planned and was assigned to me. There was some comfort in this, I didn't have to spend time figuring out if I was doing valuable work, I just did as I was told as well as I could.

Every since Citrix, where I was working in my early career, went though an "Agile Transformation", I have joined teams and worked alongside Developers.

I'm confident independent Test teams still exist, and some companies will still be working in Waterfall. My context, is that Agile and indeed being agile, is now how I expect to work and where I have experience.

Food for thought, the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#scrum-team "Scrum Guide Teams") defines a Scrum teams as consisting of:

* Developers
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master

There is no role in the guide for Tester.

## Modern Software Testing Principles

The [Modern Testing Principles](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/lessons/modern-testing-principles) - by [Alan Page](https://twitter.com/alanpage "Alan Page on Twitter") and [Brent Jensen](https://twitter.com/BrentMJensen "Brent Jensen on Twitter") have gained some popularity, and caused some controversy in the Software Testing and Development communities.

Some read the principles to mean there should be no distinct role for Testers, and instead all members of the team should share testing responsibilities.

Outrageous, you might a say, if as me you are someone who self-defines as a Software Tester.

But wait a moment, this also lines up with the Scrum Guide! So, what is there left for us Software Testers to do?
