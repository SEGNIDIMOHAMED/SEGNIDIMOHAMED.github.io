There are many competing thoughts on Software Testing and especially the roles we take on for those of us, as I do, who define as Software Testers.

How much is too much?  Are there any boundaries, and should they exist? If Testing is an activity, and Quality is a whole team responsibility, who are the Testers?

I'm going to indulge in discussing some thoughts and asking some questions. What I won't do is give definitive answers, because as it should be, your context will be different to mine.
