Tester? Quality Engineer? QA? There rare many named roles in Software Testing, that can imply different work and scope, but often involve some of the same core skills.

What is your bag? People, Process, or Product? This is the question that has led Meg to have a Job role existential crisis!

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Welcome to Quality Engineering. Go broad, deep, left, right... People, Process and Product... You need not even be called a QE, because really it&#39;s a craft or practice not a single role. Even so my role is a QE... Go figure.</p>&mdash; The Full Snack Tester (Ben Dowen) (@FullSnackTester) <a href="[https://twitter.com/FullSnackTester/status/1529206878793871361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw](https://twitter.com/FullSnackTester/status/1529206878793871361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw "https://twitter.com/FullSnackTester/status/1529206878793871361?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw")">May 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="[https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js](https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js "https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js")" charset="utf-8"></script>

In response I gleefully welcome Meg to my world, where I attempt to blend all of these things into my current role as a Quality Engineer.

Think about this a bit more, what did I mean and how can it be helpful for others?
