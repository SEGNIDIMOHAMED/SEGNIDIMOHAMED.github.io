Sometimes, people ask me how to make a start in Test Automation, or as you might correctly hear it called automated checks. While there is no one answer, because of course it depends, I can pose some questions for you to ask yourself and point you to some great resources, so lets goooo!

## Do I need to learn to code to build automation?

No, but yes, well it depends!

There are many tools that exist that do not require explicit programming language knowledge to build automation. Most of these tools do benefit from knowledge of how [**control flow**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow) and [**conditions** ]( "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Conditional")work, even if they don't need you to understand the syntax for a language.

Concepts like [**if and else statements**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#if...else_statement) and [**loops** ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)are pretty much unavoidable, and if you want to automate web pages you're going to need some idea about [**locators**](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/finders/), and it wouldn't hurt to understand the [**Document Object Model**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) (DOM).

Learning to code can also bring a bunch of other benefits, like better understanding the software you're testing and being able to have a different level of conversation with developers. So while learning to code is not a requirement for being a Tester or automating checks, I highly recommend giving it a go.

## Transition from manual to automation

If you're already working in Software Testing, but haven't yet written any automation and want to make a start, there are a few questions to ask yourself:

1. Are you looking to skill up to add automation as part of your current role at your current employer?
2. Are you looking to take on a new role, at your current employer or elsewhere?
3. Do you already know how to code, and are simply looking to gain experience in new tool or framework to start your journey?

Of course, as well as your desire, you will need the opportunities, if you don't already know what is available with your current employer it might be worth finding out by asking around.
