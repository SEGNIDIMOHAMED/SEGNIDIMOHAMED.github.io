Sometimes, people ask me how to make a start in Test Automation, or as you might correctly hear it called automated checks. While there is no one answer, because of course it depends, I can pose some questions for you to ask yourself and point you to some great resources, so lets goooo!

## Do I need to learn to code to build automation?

No, but yes, well it depends!

There are many tools that exist that do not require explicit programming language knowledge to build automation. Most of these tools do benefit from knowledge of how [**control flow**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow) and [**conditions** ]( "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Conditional")work, even if they don't need you to understand the syntax for a language.

Concepts like [**if and else statements**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#if...else_statement) and [**loops** ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)are pretty much unavoidable, and if you want to automate web pages you're going to need some idea about [**locators**](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/finders/), and it wouldn't hurt to understand the [**Document Object Model**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) (DOM).

Learning to code can also bring a bunch of other benefits, like better understanding the software you're testing and being able to have a different level of conversation with developers. So while learning to code is not a requirement for being a Tester or automating checks, I highly recommend giving it a go.

## Transition from manual to automation

If you're already working in Software Testing, but haven't yet written any automation and want to make a start, there are a few questions to ask yourself:

1. Are you looking to skill up to add automation as part of your current role at your current employer?
2. Are you looking to take on a new role, at your current employer or elsewhere?
3. Do you already know how to code, and are simply looking to gain experience in new tool or framework to start your journey?

Of course, as well as your desire, you will need the opportunities, if you don't already know what is available with your current employer it might be worth finding out by asking around.

If you've never written code, then instead of learning test automation right off the bat, you might want to pick a language and learn the fundamentals first. There are many free, and paid ways to learn how to code.

Some great places to start:

* [https://www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/ "https://www.freecodecamp.org/")
* [https://www.codecademy.com/](https://www.codecademy.com/ "https://www.codecademy.com/")
* [https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/ "https://www.w3schools.com/")

Finally, if you have the opportunity to pair with a developer or existing test automation engineer, take it! If you don't already have this opportunity, seek it out. Learning by doing, with the help of others is super valuable and will speed up your learning no end.

## Use automation to aid testing

There is no need to limit your use of automation and tools to a suite of automated checks that you might typically consider test automation. In fact if you do, you are probably doing automation and testing a disservice.

There are multiple proponents of using code and tools to support exploratory testing in different ways, one of them who I am lucky enough to work with presently is James Thomas. You can learn more about how James [**Explores with Automation**](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/meetups/lessons/exploring-with-automation-with-james-thomas).

A champion on using code in testing is [**Maaret Pyhäjärvi**](https://twitter.com/maaretp)**,** just one fine example of her work is [**Exploratory Testing on Computer Interfaces (APIs)**](), a Keynote from API Conference in 2019.

And of course, there is [**Mark Winteringham**](https://twitter.com/2bittester) and [**Richard Bradshaw**](https://twitter.com/FriendlyTester) who coined the term [**Automation in Testing**](https://automationintesting.com/)**,** and have produced fantastic courses, workshops and tools for learning how to get the best out of Automation, well beyond automated checks.

## Resources for learning

One of the absolute best resources for learning Test Automation in my experience is the [**Test Automation University**](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/)**.** Not only is it free, but the content is written by and for testers, so it's way more relevant then the odd testing focused chapter in a code course otherwise written for developers. The are even some introductions into coding on there, for example this course on [**Java Programming**](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/java-programming-course/) by [**Angie Jones**](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908) and this [**Introduction to JavaScript**](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/javascript-tutorial/) by **Mark Thompson.** There is even a whole learning path for [**Codeless automation**](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/learningpaths.html?id=codeless-path)**.**

If you don't have a background in computer science, you may also get a kick out of the [**Base.cs podcast**]()**.** In each episode the co-hosts [**Vaidehi Joshi**]() and [**Saron Yitbarek**]() introduce and discuss a topic in an approachable way, with great anecdotes, many of them food related and you know I dig that!
