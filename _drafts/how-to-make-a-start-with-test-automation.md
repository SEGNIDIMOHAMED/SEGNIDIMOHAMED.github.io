Sometimes, people ask me how to make a start in Test Automation, or as you might correctly hear it called automated checks. While there is no one answer, because of course it depends, I can pose some questions for you to ask yourself and point you to some great resources, so lets goooo!

## Do I need to learn to code to build automation?

No, but yes, well it depends!

There are many tools that exist that do not require explicit programming language knowledge to build automation. Most of these tools do benefit from knowledge of how [**control flow**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Control_flow) and [**conditions** ]( "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Conditional")work, even if they don't need you to understand the syntax for a language.

Concepts like [**if and else statements**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Control_flow_and_error_handling#if...else_statement) and [**loops** ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Loops_and_iteration)are pretty much unavoidable, and if you want to automate web pages you're going to need some idea about [**locators**](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/elements/finders/), and it wouldn't hurt to understand the [**Document Object Model**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) (DOM).

Learning to code can also bring a bunch of other benefits, like better understanding the software you're testing and being able to have a different level of conversation with developers. So while learning to code is not a requirement for being a Tester or automating checks, I highly recommend giving it a go.
