What better way to learn about the amazing people in the Software Testing Community then reading and watching their interviews.

In this short post I will introduce you to the Tester of The Day winner and community interviews, and direct you to some other great hosts who interview amazing testers!

## Tester of The day Winners Interviews

The Tester of The Day winners interviews are a great way to get a little more insight into the amazing contributors to the Software Testing Community.

We have classics, like the [interview from winner number 1, Chris McMahon](https://interviews.testeroftheday.com/interviews/2021/02/13/chris-mcmahon.html). Chris goes into some really excellent depth and his story about his favorite bug is not to be missed!

## Nicola Lindgren Interviews

Nicola has been interviewing Testers since 2013! Starting with [an interview with Markus Gaertner](https://nicolalindgren.com/2013/05/30/interview-with-markus-gaertner/), with hard hitting questions like "Where do you see software testing going in the next 5 years?" and "When your friends (outside of IT) ask you “What do you do as a software tester?”, what do you tell them?" it's worth a read to learn what Markus has to say.

And don't let the early start fool you, Nicola is still active in 2022, if anything more so with 7 interviews so far this year, phew! The [latest interview is with the amazing Lisi Hocke](https://nicolalindgren.com/2022/05/14/interview-with-lisi-hocke/), discussing ensemble testing.
