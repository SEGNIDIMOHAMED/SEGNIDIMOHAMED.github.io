				<H1>Guenoc Valley California - Tom Doak Napa Golf Resort</H1> 
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://guenocvalley.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Guenoc Valley</a> is a proposed luxury resort and residential development adjacent to Napa Valley in Lake County, California.</p>
				<p>The California Attorney General's Office has reached a settlement with the developers of the Guenoc Valley Project, a proposed luxury resort and residential development in Lake County. The settlement requires the developers to reduce the size of the project and to take steps to mitigate its environmental impact.   The settlement was completed in 2023.</p>
				<p>The Guenoc Valley Project was originally proposed in 2016. The project includes a golf course, a spa, a hotel, and homes. However, the project faced opposition from environmental groups and local residents who were concerned about its environmental impact.  Nearby in Lake County, <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/Brambles-Golf/'>Brambles Golf Club</a> is a new golf club which opened in 2023.</p>
				<p>Under the terms of the settlement, the developers of the Guenoc Valley Project have agreed to reduce the size of the project by 50%. The project will now include a golf course, a spa, and a hotel, but no homes. The developers have also agreed to take steps to mitigate the project's environmental impact, including planting trees and shrubs to help protect the watershed.</p>
				<p>Previous to the settlement, golf architect <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.doakgolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Tom Doak</a> has provided an innovative golf course <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.doakgolf.com/maha-napa-resort/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>routing plan</a> over the land where the golfer starts in location on the 29,000 acre property and finishes at the end of another part of the property.  How many golf courses have taken this approach to the journey?</p>
				<p>Tom Doak along with his co-architects from Renaissance Golf Design remain among the most active in the game in novel design.  From 2024-2027 period, anticipated openings of new golf courses will be found across the world in Mexico, Scotland, Spain, United States.  Projects like <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/SandGlass/'>SandGlass Golf Club</a> in Florida, Cabot Highlands in Scotland, <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/Majarambuz-La-Zagaleta/'>Valderrama's Majarambuz</a> in Spain, <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://fescue.github.io/Punta-Brava/'>Punta Brava</a> in Mexico are on everyone's short list to visit.</p>
