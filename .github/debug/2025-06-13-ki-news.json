(AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nSAN JOSE — Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su on Thursday unveiled a new artificial intelligence server for 2026 that aims to challenge Nvidia’s flagship offerings as OpenAI’s CEO said the ChatGPT creator would adopt AMD’s latest chips.\n\nAMD shares were down about 2% after the company announced the news at a developer conference in San Jose, California, called “Advancing AI.”\n\nSu took the stage to discuss the MI350 series and MI400 series AI chips that she said would compete with Nvidia’s Blackwell line of processors\n\nThe MI400 series of chips will be the basis of a new server called “Helios” that AMD plans to release next year.\n\nThe move comes as the competition between Nvidia and other AI chip firms has shifted away from selling individual chips to selling servers packed with scores or even hundreds of processors, woven together with networking chips from the same company.\n\n*   [**Latest updates on investing here**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/investing/)\n\nDuring its keynote presentation, AMD said that many aspects of the Helios servers - such as the networking standards - would be made openly available and shared with competitors such as Intel.\n\nThe move was a direct swipe at market leader Nvidia, which uses proprietary technology called NVLink to string together its chips but has recently started to license that technology as pressure mounts from rivals.\n\n“The future of AI is not going to be built by any one company or in a closed ecosystem. It’s going to be shaped by open collaboration across the industry,” Su said.\n\nSu was joined onstage by OpenAI’s Sam Al",
