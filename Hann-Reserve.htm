	        	<h1>Hann Resort - New Clark City - Philippines</h1>
			<p>Hann Reserve is a luxury golf resort in New Clark City, Philippines set to offer golfers/leisure travelers a one-of-a-kind experience of play with three distinct golf courses.  The <a href='https://www.ggrasia.com/first-part-of-hann-reserve-completed-2025-says-backer/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Hann Reserve project broke ground</a> for the exclusive PGA of America-affiliated luxury golf resort destination in the Philippines on November 5, 2022. As the largest ultra-luxe integrated golf resort in the country, Hann Development Corp. (HDC) unveiled its grand 450-hectare Hann Reserve in the ground-breaking ceremony which led by HDC Chairman and CEO Daesik Han and golf legend <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Faldo' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Sir Nick Faldo</a> with his wife Lady Lindsay Faldo.  Additionally, Senator Mark Villar, House Speaker Martin Romualdez, Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation(PAGCOR) Chairman Al Tengco, Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) Chairman Delfin Lorenzana, and Clark Development Corporation(CDC) Chairman Ed Pamintuan with CDC CEO Agnes Devanadera.</p>
			<p>Part of the New Clark City build out is a solar farm project. Once completed, residents in the area will benefit from a consistent and low-cost electricity supply. The strategically located 90 acre solar farm will have direct access to a nearby substation for reduced transmission costs and a more reliable power distribution network. BCDA aims to attract private companies to bid for the project, which requires a minimum capacity of 25 megawatts with minimum investment of PHP 1 billion. This initiative aligns with the government’s push for renewable energy sources and sustainability.  The project is part of the Philippines government’s ESG push for renewable energy sources.</p>
