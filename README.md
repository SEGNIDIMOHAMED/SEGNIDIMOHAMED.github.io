# Jekyll Notes Site

This repository contains a simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site for notes.
To build or preview the Markdown files locally:

1. Install Ruby (>=3.0) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/).
2. Run `bundle install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start a local server, or `bundle exec jekyll build` to create the `_site` directory.

All generated files such as `_site/` and `Gemfile.lock` are ignored by Git.
