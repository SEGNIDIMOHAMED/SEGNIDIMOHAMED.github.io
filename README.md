# Notes on this repo

### Source

This was forked from another repo, so keep that in mind.

### Installing & Running

There is a dockerfile in the repo. A few notes:

1. You can just use `build_and_run_server.sh` to run everything. Or...

1. First build the image
```
docker build . -t jekyll
```

1. Run the container. The first command does it interactively the second does it via jekyll with an automatic reload
```
docker run -it -p 4000:4000 -v ${PWD}:/site jekyll /bin/bash
```
```
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v ${PWD}:/site jekyll 
```

1. Remember that all pushes to main will end up on github.io and hence `www.nickross.site`


### How to update things

1. Resume should be updated occassionaly -- make sure to remove address

### Some random ruby notes

* Jekyll is the static web site creator
* `bundle` is something like `pip`, but it allows for local/global versions, so kinda like `pyenv`/`npm`. _This is NOT being used here._
* There are only a few `gems` being installed in order to run this, all of them are installed via the `dockerfile` which is probably not good practice but works for this purpose.

### How to generate a new section

* Add it to the `_config.yml` under collections
* Create a new directory with the underscore
* Create a new top level `md` file which accesses it
* Add a layout file to (`_layout`) and make sure the layout matches that of the new section type
* Add it to `layouts/default.html` if you want it in the bar
