I've noticed a trend since the pandemic: entry-level job seekers seem less comfortable with in-person networking events. This can be a missed opportunity, as face-to-face meetings can be one of the most effective ways to advance your career. Here are some thoughts and best practices!

### Why Are Meetups Useful?

*   **Face-to-Face Time:** Interacting with people in person is powerful. It's much harder for someone to ignore a person they've met and had a conversation with than a name on a resume.
*   **The Hidden Job Market:** Many jobs are never publicly posted. Companies often prefer to hire through referrals or from people they've met at industry events. You may also get information about companies you _don't_ want to work for. 
*   **Market Intelligence:** Meetups are a great way to get a feel for the job market. You can see which companies are hiring, what skills are in demand, and what the general sentiment is in your industry.
*   **Information:** You can absorb a lot of information at meetups. You'll hear about interesting problems, new technologies, and different approaches to work. This not only makes you a more knowledgeable professional but also gives you great talking points for future interviews. 

### Events I'd go to and how I find them.

I tend to focus on free, smaller meetups. Here's my general approach:

*   **Finding Events:** [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com) and [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com) are the best places to find these. In most urban areas, you can find something happening almost pretty regularly. I also keep a look out for larger cornerstone conferences, such as city tech weeks or big industry conferences which will sometimes spin out smaller events.
*   **In-Person is Key:** I almost exclusively look for in-person events, especially if I'm actively job searching. The value of face-to-face interaction can't be overstated.
*   **Go Technical (or Niche):** Look for technical meetups in data science, computer science, or a specific industry. Don't be afraid to attend even if you don't understand everything. I once went to a Postgres meetup where the entire talk was over my head, but I still met interesting people and had a great time.
*   **Industry-Specific Events:** These can be goldmines for technical people. Often, you'll be one of the few data or tech-focused individuals there, which makes you stand out. For example, at a supply chain conference, you might be the only person with your skillset. If there is a larger conference in your area there are often discounted student tickets or job recruiting specific events. These, once again, can be great opportunities. 
*   **A-la-carte "Networking":** I generally avoid paid "networking events" unless I get a strong recommendation. They tend to hit-or-miss, and I've heard stories of events where everyone attending is also looking for a job.

### What to Do When You're There

*   **Have a Goal:** It can be as simple as "meet three new people." Having a goal helps you stay focused and gives you a sense of accomplishment.
*   **Graceful Exits:** Don't be afraid to politely exit a conversation that isn't a good fit. However, give it some time; conversations can often meander before getting to something interesting.
*   **Don't Badger:** Don't constantly ask people about job openings. It comes across as desperate and is a turn-off. The same goes for asking for a LinkedIn connection immediately after meeting someone; talk to them for a bit first.
*   **Read the Room (Use your EQ):** It's better to leave no impression than a bad one. Be polite, be a good listener, and be yourself.
*   **Business Cards & Resumes:** In the tech circles I frequent, handing out physical resumes or even business cards is seen as old-fashioned. A LinkedIn connection after a good conversation is the modern equivalent.
*   **Have Fun and Learn:** This is the most important part. If you go in with a genuine desire to learn something new and meet interesting people, you'll have a much better experience and make a better impression.
