I recently got more involved in the testing community, signing up to the Ministry of Test and getting on the Slack Channels. From this I learned two things:

1. My 9+ years of experience do not mean I know everything, in fact a bunch of my knowledge is plain out of date!
2. As with Software Development, modern testing is developing and changing rapidly, and I need to get involved and innovate to keep up.

### More Information

The excellent folks on the MoT slack channels encouraged and inspired me to finally start blogging. Thank you!
