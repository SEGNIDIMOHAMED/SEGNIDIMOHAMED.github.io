				<H1>Sherrill Park Course #2 - Muni Renovation</H1>
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.sherrillparkgolf.com/course-2/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Sherrill Park Course #2</a> is under renovation in 2024 with a planned reopening of October 2024.  The golf course was last renovated 22 years ago in 2001 underwent a planning study with <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.facebook.com/WeibringWolfardGolf/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Weibring Wolfard Golf Design</a> and Freese & Nichols in 2021-2022.  Design features of the renovation aim to resolve major drainage issues, improve playability and reduce maintenance, enhance turf and vegetation, and make aesthetic improvements.</p>
				<p>Drainage concerns were present on Hole 1 and 17 where water backs up, causing delays in opening the course after heavy rainfalls.  On Hole 5, the pond is completely filled with silt and needs to be rebuilt and enlarged. The existing bunkers have poor drainage and deteriorated lining, which will be replaced with new style bunkers allowing improved maintenance.</p>
				<p>Erosion control is needed to save the Hole 6 fairway, and drainage needs to be improved for safety along the cart path. There are also playability opportunities on Hole #2 and Hole #6. On Hole #2, the lake to the right of the fairway landing area will be eliminated to improve playability for all handicap levels.  Tree management program is to trim and remove in many areas. On Hole #6, willow trees along the creek will be removed to open up visibility.  Additional trees will be added to the right of the landing area to improve safety.</p>
				<p>Construction schedule is progressing through with final design work underway. The renovation project was dependent on the US Army Corps of Engineers to review of drainage work.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://landscapesunlimited.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Landscapes Unlimited</a> was awarded the construction contract in December 2023.  Construction schedule is from January 2024 through September 2024.</p>
				<p>The renovation project is funded by a $9 Million in Certificate of Obligation issued in April. This funding will cover the renovation costs and contribute to the overall improvement of Sherrill Park Golf Course.</p>
