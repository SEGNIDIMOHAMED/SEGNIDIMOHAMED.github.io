			<p>Ridgewood Country Club is a private golf club located in Waco, Texas.  The club was founded in 1947 with golf architect <a href='https://asgca.org/architect/rplummer/ target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ralph Plummer</a> designing the 18 hole golf course.  A significant renovation occurred in 1963 to accommodate the expansion of Lake Waco.  Jon Snider is Director of Grounds and Golf Course Superintendent.  Ridgewood Country Club is also home to tennis courts, swimming pool, and a fitness center.</p>
			<p>Golf course renovation is being led by golf course architect <a href='https://golfclubatlas.com/feature-interview/feature-interview-with-tripp-davis/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Tripp Davis</a>.  Tripp has had recent success at both restoration of classic golf courses including <a href='https://fescue.github.io/Thunderbird-Country-Club' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Thunderbird Country Club in Rancho Mirage</a>, Atlanta Athletic Club, Augusta Country Club, Oak Hills Country Club in San Antonio, Oklahoma City Golf & Country Club.  Tripp enjoyed success in competitive golf as a junior at AJGA and in college golf at the University of Oklahoma winning the national championship.</p> Pre-renovation the golf course measured 6,850 yards from the back tees. The course has scenic topography overlooking Lake Waco. Post renovation, the greens are being converted from bentgrass to TifEagle.  Project Superintendent is Greg Smith.  New tees are being constructed, and fairways are being replanted in bermudagrass.  Fleetwood Golf Construction is assisting in the build, bunker shaping, and green construction.</p>
			<p>Original architect Ralph Plummer designed/renovated over 80 courses.  Plummer began his career as a golf professional in South Texas in the early 1920s and went on to work as an assistant to architect John Bredemus who designed many courses in Texas.  Like Tripp Davis, Plummer was known to be hands on, talented in the dirt shaper in golf construction.  His courses are known for their strategic design using natural features that he found in the field while building the golf course.   Some of Plummer's other notable courses include Preston Trail Golf Club in Dallas, Texas, Champions Golf Club in Houston, Texas, and Midland Country Club in Midland, Texas.  Plummer was elected to the American Society of Golf Course Architects(ASGCA) in 1956 serving as President of the ASGCA from 1962-1963.  Tripp Davis applies Plummer's design sense in this update to the golf course.</p>
