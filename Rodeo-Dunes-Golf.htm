        <h1>Previewing New Dream Golf in Colorado</h1>
		<p><a href='https://www.rodeodunes.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Rodeo Dunes</a> is a new golf resort initiative announced in 2023.  The golf courses are being constructed in the eastern plains of Colorado, near the town of Roggen. Roggen, Colorado is 42 miles from Denver International Airport (DIA) with a drive time is 45 minutes on Interstate 76 West. It is the brainchild of Michael and Chris Keiser, the sons of Bandon Dunes developer Mike Keiser. The land is over 2,000 acres.  The soil type is characterized as sandy, ideal for golf.  The first golf course is being designed by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmy-snails-craig-35009979/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jim Craig</a>.  Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw will design subsequent golf courses.</p><p>Anticipation for the destination is high.</p>

        <h2>Raw Ingredients</h2>
			<p>The terrain is rolling, mild elevation changes in the topography with <a href='https://coloradoavidgolfer.com/ready-to-ride/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>long views over the Colorado plains</a> toward the Front Range and Longs Peak in the Rockies.  The site reminds Michael Keiser of Irish linksâ€”courses in the West of Ireland with heaving dunes that in places reach 85 feet high.  Rodeo Dunes is expected to open in 2024 and will be a public golf resort.</p>
			<p>The property was previously owned by the Cervi family who operated a ranching farm on the land and ran the Cervi Championship Rodeo Company, the largest rodeo producer in the country.  The name "Rodeo Dunes" is a nod to the property's history as a ranch, as well as the rolling, sandy terrain that resembles a rodeo arena.  Ownership is under <a href='https://dreamgolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Dream Golf</a> <a href='https://dreamgolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Dream Golf</a>, the company that also owns Bandon Dunes in Oregon, Sand Valley in Wisconsin.  The golf courses at Rodeo Dunes are expected to be challenging but fair by limiting forced carries from different tees.</p>
