			<H1>Fall Line Golf Club - Sand Hills in Georgia</H1>
			<p>Fall Line Golf Club is a private golf club being designed by <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.ocm.golf/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Oglivy Cocking Mead (OCM)</a> in Georgia.  The first course is in play as of March 2024.  The second course will open in 2025.  Fall Line is located in the Georgia Sandhills region, near Butler, Georgia.  OCM have designed two full 18 hole courses and a 12 hole short course.  In an interview on <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://thefriedegg.com/fried-egg-podcast/mike-cocking-of-ocm-on-breaking-into-the-u-s-market-and-remaking-medinah-4/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>The Fried Egg Podcast</a> with Andy Johnson, golf architect Mike Cocking from OCM has expressed inspiration for one course as coming from heathland golf in England and inspiration for the other course coming from Cocking's native Australian sandbelt with bunker edging cut to the green's edge.  Additionally, a Himalayas putting green has been built resembling the putting course in St. Andrews, Scotland.</p>
			<p>  Matthew Oggero, CCM(Club Managers Association of America), will be General Manager.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/august-rocco-93b86aa3/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>August Rocco</a> is the Golf Course Superintendent at Fall Line Golf Club. He has been with the club since April 2023. Rocco has a degree in Turfgrass Management from the University of Georgia and has over 10 years of experience in the golf course industry. He is a certified Golf Course Superintendent by the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America.  He is responsible for the care and maintenance of a golf course during the initial stages of the project, including seeding, watering, and fertilizing the turf, as well as controlling pests and diseases.  Grow-in superintendents play a critical role in ensuring that a new golf course is able to establish itself and provide a high quality playing surfaces.  The Georgia Sandhills area is an area where the ancient seashore was located over 65 million years ago resulting in a series of sand dunes ranging in height from 450 to 750 feet above sea level.  The sandy soil in the Sandhills is ideal for drainage on a firm, fast running golf course. Composed of quartz (SiO2), the sand has great permeability due to the absence of organic matter in the soil allowing rainwater to drain rapidly through the sandy soil, preventing waterlogging and maintaining perfect playability of the course.</p>
			<p>The property is adjacent to the <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://georgiawildlife.com/sandhills-wma-west' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Sandhills Wildlife Management Area (WMA)</a>, a 4,200-acre property located in Taylor County, Georgia managed by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR). The area is known for its sandy hills, pine forests, and diverse wildlife. The WMA offers a variety of recreational opportunities, including hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping.  Nearby in Mauk, the <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places_listings_in_Taylor_County,_Georgia#Current_listings' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mauk School</a> is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Taylor County.</p>
