title: California Air Resource Board Carbon Offset Sites

A friend of a [friend](https://james27.com/) started posted some information on Evergrow, a startup idea to use private money to purchase land to reforest and then sell both the offsets and timber. This got me thinking a bit about what a California Carbon offset _looks_ like. In particular, I wanted to know a bit more about what these projects are. The California Air Resources Board publishes a list of approved project, how many tons of carbon offset and some other information. I decided to download and plot the data (as usual, all code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/NickRoss/ARB).

    <a href="https://plotly.com/~kejnn/80/" target="_blank" title="ADP" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plotly.com/~kejnn/80.png" alt="ADP" style="max-width: 100%;width: 600px;"  width="600" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plotly.com/404.png';" /></a>
    <script data-plotly="kejnn:80" src="https://plotly.com/embed.js" async></script>
</div>

A few take-aways:
1. I expected more of the projects to be _in_ California.
1. There are a lot of dairy offset projects that I'd like to learn more about.
1. I don't know a lot about this market and would like to learn more...
