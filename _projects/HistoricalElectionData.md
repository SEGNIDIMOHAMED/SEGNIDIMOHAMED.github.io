title: Idea&#58 Historical Election Data

National Election Results for historical elections can be found [here](https://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/). The information contained in these PDFs are the certified election results for federal elections going all the way back to 1920. This is all pretty well known and looking up a single result is pretty easy. The data itself is not, however, digitized (I got this idea reading the tweet below).

An interesting project would be to digitize the results and put them in a data repository. The data itself is small enough that you could conceivably put your code and the resulting data into github. To give you a sense of what these pages look like, the following is a sample:


<div style="text-align: center"><img src="/images/OpenElections2.webp" width="500" alt="Sample page from historical election results PDF showing tabular data format" /></div>

As you can see the data is pretty straight forward -- it is a set of tables with election results put in a pretty standard format. It wouldn't surprise me if you could combine an off the shelf deep learning based tabular OCR system with a ton of annoying glue code to generate this data. Importantly, there are a _lot_ of ways that you could error check the OCR process since much of the data also contains summary statistics.
