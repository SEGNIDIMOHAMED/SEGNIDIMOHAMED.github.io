        <p>The front of the phone handles the normal phone duties. Whilst the back of the phone is a multimedia centre
            handling movies, photos, music and file transfer&hellip;</p>
        <p>The layout and shape of the phone was designed for easy operation and comfortable viewing of multimedia in
            both portrait and landscape orientations.</p>

                Power Point interface of the phones UI.</p>
            <p>aideM featured in &lsquo;Fiction Hotel,&rsquo; an exhibit at Kulturhuset,

        <p>An electronic calendar. One for unit for home and one for office, the units synchronise, once docked onto
            their stand, over a standard phoneline connection ensuring they are always fully up to date. </p>
        <p>For example, amendments made to the organiser information at home by the wife, appear on the husbands unit at
            work.</p>
        <p>The name <em>Kalanda</em> is a hybrid of calendar and LAN (Local Area Network), to highlight the connectivity
            of the device.</p>
        <aside>
            <p>Kalanda was modeled in Alias Studiotools and put in situ using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

        <p>Simpla was an exercise in redesigning the humble stapler to require fewer components for more simple and
            cheaper manufacture.</p>
        <p>Through clever use of materials and design, the stapler has a natural flex which does away with the need for
            a hinge section and thus reducing the number of components. The design has a strong resemblance to a hair
            grip or clip and this emphasises the notion of flexibility.</p>

        <p>The cooler project was based on Igloo Coolers, a popular american brand of cooler.</p>
        <p>Take&gt;About is a lunchbox form factor for the school market. It features a two part form, the outer half
            provides the cool pack and sturdy protection, plus detachable shoulder strap. The draw fastens securely and
            can be removed for cleaning.</p>

    <div>
        <p>Safe-2-O is a travel product for the average tourist to take away with them to purify the local water whilst
            on holiday. A brief dose from the germicidal lamp kills any harmful bacteria present in the local water. The
            product is designed to be much more travel friendly for the casual tourist to take away and keep them safe
            on their journey compared to more cubersome or techincal water purifying processes.</p>
        <p>The device emits UV light in the UVC band, which destroys the DNA of any harmful bacteria rendering them
            effectively harmless.</p>
