title: San Juan Islands Bike Trip 2021
---
Posting this a few months late, but wanted to share a few photos and stories from a bike trip my dad and I took in October in the San Juan Islands.

# Day 1: Orcas Island

It was a little rainy on this day, but it cleared up in the afternoon so we hopped on the bikes. Orcas wasn't super bike-friendly overall; the bike lanes were narrow or nonexistent, we kept getting passed by dump trucks en route to excavation work, and there were lots of blind corners. I felt sketchy about continuing to ride in those conditions, so we kept the ride shorter than planned.

# Day 2: San Juan Island

We caught the ferry from Orcas to San Juan in the morning. We lucked out with a beautiful, clear fall day. We rode a counterclockwise loop around the island starting at Friday Harbor.

One highlight of this day was biking past a property that was decorated with these large sculptures, including one of Spongebob's house.

# Day 3: Lopez Island

We also lucked out with a sunny day on Lopez, a small island just south of Orcas. We rode the short loop around this island. Out of the three, Lopez was my favorite. It was the most bike-friendly, relatively flat overall, very scenic, and there was hardly any traffic. I would love to come back sometime and stay for a few days in the summer.

# What to know if you go

As you might expect, in these COVID times, there are labor shortages on the ferries. Give yourself some buffer time traveling between islands.
