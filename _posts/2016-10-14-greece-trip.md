title: Greece Trip

My girlfriend and I recently spent a week in Greece. Our *original* plan was to spend a week on the island of Corfu, part of the Ionian Islands off the Western coast.

We enjoyed a couple of relaxing beach days after we arrived:

And had some excellent food and Greek wine:

And met some friendly stray dogs:

But then this happened:

So we hopped on a plane to Athens for a few days.
While there, we explored the Acropolis:

Visited the Temple of Poseidon:

Saw this strikingly T-Rex-like dog:

Sat in the king and queen thrones at the original Olympic stadium:

And visited Brettos, the oldest distillery in Athens.

We flew back to Corfu for a day to find that the sun had returned, and enjoyed a final day on the beach before our flight back home:

Greece was beautiful, the food was excellent, and the people were so friendly and welcoming. We hope to go back soon.
