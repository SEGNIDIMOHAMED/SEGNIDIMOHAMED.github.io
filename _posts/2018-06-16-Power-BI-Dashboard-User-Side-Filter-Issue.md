title: Power BI Dashboard User Side Filter Issue
---

I was asked two questions about Power BI recently. 
Q1.  For a given dashboard, how user can filter data at his/her will?
Q2. How user can keep his/her default filter?

Q1. For first question, visualization pane has slicer, you can bring in one slicer or multiple slicer to the dashboard. User can choose filter value as you like. I use the student-class example in previous post to illustrate that.

This is unfiltered dashboard

I add a slicer and drug in the studentname filter in the slicer. From the slicer, I choose Mary.
