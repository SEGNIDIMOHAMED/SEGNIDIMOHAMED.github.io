title: 'Trail of the Couer d''Alenes Ride, September 2022'
---
My dad and I spent Sept 10 cycling
the [Trail of the Couer d'Alenes](https://parksandrecreation.idaho.gov/parks/trail-coeur-d-alenes/).
This trail is a rails-to-trails paved ride that has been on our list ever since we first got our gravel bikes just over
a year ago.
We stayed at the Wallace Inn, and took the Cycle Haus shuttle to Harrison.
From Harrison, we rode to the trail's beginning in Plummer, then rode back to Harrison.
We took that route because it would've been a much longer shuttle around the lake to the very beginning of the trail.
