I came across an article that claimed a piece of analysis failed because of ‘bad’ data. 

It reminded me of a phrase I used to hear on the trading floor, “US non-farm payrolls beat estimates”.

Is it possible for data to be inherently good or bad? I am not convinced. The state of data should only be that they 
exist, and are held as the truth because they exist. In other words, US non-farm payrolls didn't beat estimates, your 
estimate was too low.

There must be another reason to explain the system’s unexpected performance. Consider the following paradigm.

When applied to a machine learning or data science project might give something like the following 4 steps.

Putting my paranoid/Trader cap on, 4 steps mean 4 modes of failure. 

The rest of this blog shall pay close attention to mode 2. Otherwise labelled as DevOps, data architecture, data engineering.
 I never know which one to use so I’ll stick with ‘move data from there to here’.

The aim of this blog is to challenge myself and hopefully the reader to think about big data systems at a layer of 
abstraction that remains invariant in time.

Learn to fish and you’ll never be hungry, or something like that.

Stick around and you can expect to explore:
* Database principles
* Types of failure
* Lambda architecture
* Where today’s tools fit in
* Lots of hand-drawn diagrams...no one does them anymore

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
