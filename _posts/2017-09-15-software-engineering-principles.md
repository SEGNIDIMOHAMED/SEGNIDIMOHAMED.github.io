title: Software Engineering Principles
---
The following are a few principles of good software engineering that I've learned in my career.

**Dependency Inversion Principle (aka Inversion of Control)**
**Single Responsibility Principle:** Every class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by that class.
**Principle of Least Privilege**
**DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
**YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**
**Kaizen:** Leave things better than how you found them.
