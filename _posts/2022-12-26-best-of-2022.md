Travel
I felt some intense stir-craziness after not getting much of a change in scenery during the early pandemic years and have been grateful to have been able to travel so much this year.

Some friends and I went on a road trip to Joshua Tree and another to Bryce Canyon and Zion. In July, another group of friends and I spent 4 days camping on the playa in the Alvord Desert. 

My dad and I went on several bike trips, including the Banks-Vernonia Trail and the Trail of the Couer d’Alenes, in Idaho.

In the fall, my girlfriend Nicole and I did a road trip to Banff, visited some good friends of hers in Denver, and spent 11 days in Costa Rica. I also went to a conference for work in Los Angeles. 

In between, I’ve made several trips during the week to Bend to work from there and visit family, which has been really nice.
