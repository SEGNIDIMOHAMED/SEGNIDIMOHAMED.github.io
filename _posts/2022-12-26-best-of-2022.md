A few favorite things from 2022, in no particular order ðŸ™‚.

# Travel
I felt some intense stir-craziness after not getting much of a change in scenery during the early pandemic years and have been grateful to have been able to travel so much this year.

Some friends and I went on a road trip to Joshua Tree and another to Bryce Canyon and Zion. In July, another group of friends and I spent 4 days camping on the playa in the Alvord Desert. 

My dad and I went on several bike trips, including the Banks-Vernonia Trail and the Trail of the Couer dâ€™Alenes, in Idaho.

In the fall, my girlfriend Nicole and I did a road trip to Banff, visited some good friends of hers in Denver, and spent 11 days in Costa Rica. I also went to a conference for work in Los Angeles. 

In between, Iâ€™ve made several trips during the week to Bend to work from there and visit family, which has been really nice.

# Books

I read 47 books this year, totalling 14,368 pages. That's an increase of 2,726 pages and 7 books over last year,
with the caveat that several were audiobooks and I spent a lot of time on the road ðŸ™‚.

Some favorites were:
* Chip War
* Skepticâ€™s Guide to the Future
* An Immense World
