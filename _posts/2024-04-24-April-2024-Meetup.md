### Headlines

#### MicroPython v1.23 Release

![MPLogo](../images/2024-04/mplogo.png)

It's taking a little longer than expected, but the v1.23 release is shaping up
to be a big one! Check out the [release-1.23.0
milestone](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/milestone/6) for the
current status.

Still to resolve: IPv6, PyScript issues and USB Device support.

#### CircuitPython 9.0

![CircuitPython9](../images/2024-04/cp9.jpg)

Congrats to our CircuitPython 'cousins' who have ust released version 9.0! Some
very cool additions, including USB Host, synthio updates, as well as merging in
MicroPython 1.21. (Ed: 9.0.4 is the latest bugfix release at the time of
writing)

#### Espressif acquires majority stake in M5Stack

![Espressif and M5Stack](../images/2024-04/espressif-m5stack.jpg)

In a [press
release](https://www.espressif.com/en/news/Espressif_Acquires_M5Stack),
Espressif announced they were investing in a majority share of M5Stack. And
M5Stack maintain that '[nothing
changes](https://twitter.com/M5Stack/status/1782337405242294337)' in how they
operate.

#### Renesas buys Altium

![Renesas Altium](../images/2024-04/renesas_altium.png)

Japanese chip manufacturer Renesas plans to acquire PCB deisgn software Altium
for A$9.1 billion (!).

[eeNews: Renesas to buy PCB design software firm Altium for US$5.9
billion](https://www.eenewseurope.com/en/renesas-to-buy-pcb-design-software-firm-altium-for-us5-9-billion)

#### Arduino Days

![ArduinoDays](../images/2024-04/arduino_days.jpg)

[Arduino Days](https://days.arduino.cc/) was a three-day event talking about all
things Arduino - which, these days, includes a lot of MicroPython stuff.

Everything was live streamed and is available on YouTube.

### Matt's New hardware

#### M5Stack care package

![M5StackCarePackage](../images/2024-04/m5stack_carepackage.png)

- [M5Stack Dial](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-dial-esp32-s3-smart-rotary-knob-w-1-28-round-touch-screen)
- [M5Stack Din Meter](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-din-meter-w-m5stamps3)
- [M5Stack Cardputer Kit](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-cardputer-kit-w-m5stamps3)
- [M5Stack NanoC6](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stack-nanoc6-dev-kit)
- +Other peripherals!

#### STM32U083RC Nucleo

![STM32NUCLOE-U083RC](../images/2024-04/stm32nucleo-u083rc.png)

Super low power but with a Cortex-M0 @56MHz, 256KB flash and 40KB RAM it should
be a decent device for MicroPython!

#### Gurgle Word Clock

The Gurgle Word Clock is the [first kit by the Gurgle
folks](https://twitter.com/GurgleApps/status/1775204450849673563) and provides
all the parts you need to create a beautiful *Word Clock*, where words are lit
by a NeoPixel panel to display the time.

![Gurgle Apps Word Clock](../images/2024-04/gurglewordclock.png)

The [kit can be
purchased](https://gurgleapps.com/reviews/electronics/wifi-controlled-color-word-clock-kit-micropython)
complete or in parts, and the 3D models and MicroPython software are [open
source](https://github.com/gurgleapps/Gurgle-Apps-Word-Clock/).

It's such a fantastic little project! I think it will be of particular interest
to parents looking to build a relatively simple STEM project with their teen
child...or if you just want an attractive Word Clock!

#### Embedded Open Source Summit

![Build Wireless Products Faster with Zephyr and MicroPython](../images/2024-04/zephyrandmicropython.png)

[Build Wireless Products Faster with Zephyr and
MicroPython](https://eoss24.sched.com/event/1aBFA) - Ryan Erickson

Video: See the [recorded livestream from
~7:34](https://www.youtube.com/live/nq1dvz3skUc?si=cgz7nq09yQArVz_d&t=27272).

Really interesting; runs MicroPython as a module in Zephyr, provides Zephyr
filesystem to MicroPython and allows access to C drivers. Slightly different
perspective to the MicroPython Zephyr port, though there is a lot that could be
reused.

#### Rust vs MicroPython

![Rust vs MicroPython](../images/2024-04/rustvsmp.png)

Kevin McAleer dons the fire-proof vest [Code Wars: Rust vs
MicroPython](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9LekkoQyf0)

#### MicroPython Flipper Zero

![MicroPython on Flipper Zero](../images/2024-04/mponflipper.png)

Run MicroPython as an application on the Flipper Zero with
[mp-flipper](https://github.com/ofabel/mp-flipper). (Unless you're in Canada!)

#### Raspberry Pi Pico W Lessons for Absolute Beginners

![RPi Pico W Lessons](../images/2024-04/paulmcwhorter.png)

Paul McWhorter continues to [release lessons on the RPi Pico
W](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGs0VKk2DiYz8js1SJog21cDhkBqyAhC5).
His first was over a year ago and he's just published #66 - with another 13
already scheduled. Many use MicroPython.

#### MicroPython on the Playdate

![MicroPython on the Playdate](../images/2024-04/mponplaydate.jpeg)

[Christian Walther](https://fosstodon.org/@isziaui@mstdn.social) demonstrates
[MicroPython running on the
Playdate](https://fosstodon.org/@isziaui@mstdn.social/112230897686298712)!

He recently published his repository
[pew-playdate](https://github.com/cwalther/pew-playdate). I'm itching to try it
out! Christian's goal is to be able to get "[Pew
Pew](https://fosstodon.org/@isziaui@mstdn.social)" games running on the
Playdate.

#### Antirez

![Antirez](../images/2024-04/antirez_eink.jpg)

- [Viper](https://twitter.com/antirez/status/1766588917245968643)
  - "Using MicroPython Viper...a 20x speed-up. C-level performance"
  - "Viper is a beast"
  - "...with Viper I found little or zero uses for C..."
- [Small random ideas thread about embedded
  programming...](https://twitter.com/antirez/status/1762774948240625723)
  - "In the embedded world MicroPython may be regarded as something just for
    hobbists, not suitable for real work. I beg to differ"
  - The whole thread is worth a read

This is just in the last month...
