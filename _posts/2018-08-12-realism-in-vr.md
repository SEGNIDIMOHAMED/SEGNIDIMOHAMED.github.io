While virtual environments aren't subject to gravitation or other such real world forces, for VR users to feel sufficiently immersed some measure of realism needs to be presented. At the very least, even in highly stylised environments, the scaling and sense of 'solidity' should be spot on.

Just how pedantic designers will need to go with all this is hard to guage, but getting the balance right will be one of the markers by which we can judge quality of virtual spaces.

Without meaning to thrust architectural theory upon VR space design, there are some important elements often absent from end products that really should be given greater credence; I'll discuss some of these below.

### Walls:

While Architects have been pushing boundaries since time immemorial, their attempts ultimately exist within the realms of physical reality. Boundaries formed by solid impenetrable walls reinforce this fact; indeed, when the wall thicknesses are on full display and even celebrated, this provides further psychological reassurance.

In VR, any connection formed with the simulated world, any feeling of immersion, immediately breaks down when users are simply able to pop their heads throughW walls and other objects! Even much loved VR games (e.g. Robo-Recall) are guilty of this.

This cannot be seen as acceptable; any time this happens, it makes me cringe and generally cheapens the experience.

Standard 3D desktop games don't have this problem: characters can't just walk through walls unless intentional (e.g. magic potion) or the developers have missed something. This wall collision issue is something unique to VR.

### Dealing with 'wall peek':
![Head colliding with wall](https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.expresswriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/03074837/head-on-wall-750x360.jpg)

Game designers have various solutions to 'wall peek' at their disposal, the most common being:-
1.  As head goes through a simulated wall, the screen goes black or blurred.
2. Walking through wall results in simulation, at the point of impact, moving along with user.
3. As head impacts a wall, the player is instantaneously 'snapped' back to a point just before their head impacted; because of how quickly this happens, there's not much scope for nausea. Realising that walls can’t be penetrated, users would stop trying and it no longer becomes an issue.
4. A combination of '1' and '3'; where screen goes black, they're pushed back to their last valid location and screen quickly fades in to view again. All this happens within a couple of seconds.

All of these have their pros and cons, but by far the worst solution is where there's no prevention whatsoever from wall peeking. This is just lazy! 

With the 1st solution, users often find themselves becoming 'lost' in the dark zone behind walls and large so-called barriers; this  is highly disconcerting. The 2nd solution can mess up room-scale playspace setup and having the entire world moving along with head seems weird.

On balance however, I believe the 3rd solution to be the smartest; in fact it's what the majority of post 2017 VR games seem to have gravitated towards. The following are a list of VR games that I know of that do employ this method:-
* Serious Sam III VR.
* Talos Principle.
* Skyrim VR
* In Death.
* A-Tech Cybernetic.
