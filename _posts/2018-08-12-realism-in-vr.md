While virtual environments aren't subject to gravitation or other such real world forces, for VR users to feel sufficiently immersed some measure of realism needs to be presented. At the very least, even in highly stylised environments, the scaling and sense of 'solidity' should be spot on.

Just how pedantic designers will need to go with all this is hard to guage, but getting the balance right will be one of the markers by which we can judge quality of virtual spaces.

Without meaning to thrust architectural theory upon VR space design, there are some important elements often absent from end products that really should be given greater credence; I'll discuss some of these below.
