Every student, upcoming developer and IT professional should have a blog where they can share their thoughts, knowledge and inspiration.

Creating and maintaining a blog can improve your communication skills, help others and re-affirm what you've learnt.

However, 'what to write about?' can often be the hardest part. So I posed this question to the [Dev(){CoP}](https://devcop.io/) community and here is what they had to say.

## Pick a theme

Before you begin, pick a theme or get a broad sense of what you want to write about. Understanding this will make coming up with ideas far easier as you'll be focussed on one specific area.

For example, if you want to be known as a web developer specialising in frontend, you might base your blogs around HTML, CSS and ReactJS. 

Once you have your theme in mind, you can start to build your blog around this.

## Problems that you've solved

Being in any IT role is about facing and solving problems.

By writing about the problems you have solved, you can re-affirm what you've learnt and possibly help someone else out in the process.

Besides this, it also acts as a reference in the event you encounter the problem again.

## Online courses

Since IT is an ever-growing field, there's always something more to be learnt.

As you go through an online course, perhaps you can document your learnings or note down some key takeaways from the program.

Doing this can act as referesher but it may also help someone else who is deciding whether to enrol in the course.

## Things that annoy you

As you go along your IT journey, there are bound to be things that annoy you.

For example, say you've been working on a project and you've been deploying code manually. But then you realise how tedious this can be, leading you to automate this process.

From this, you can write about all your frustrations, including a walkthrough of your solution; in turn someone else may be able to avoid the same hassles.

## Open Source Projects 

Open Source Projects are a great way to get invovled, give back and gain practical experience.

You can keep track of your experience by documenting what you've been working on and any roadblocks that you've encountered.

This is an excellent way to measure your progress and further cement your knowledge.

## Summary

Essentially, writing blogs is a means of documenting your learnings and sharing what you know.

The easiest way to come up with ideas is to keep your blog focussed and simply write about what you've been working on.

I would like to thank the [Dev(){CoP}](https://devcop.io/) community for helping me come up with this list. If you have any further ideas or would like to have a discussion about this blog, please feel free to reach out!
