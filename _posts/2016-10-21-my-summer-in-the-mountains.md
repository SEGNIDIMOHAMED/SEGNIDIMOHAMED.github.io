Between graduating college and starting work at Jive, I spent two months working as an IT sysadmin at Holden Village, a remote, former mining town in Northern Washington. And by “remote” I mean VERY remote. The only ways to get there are by either hiking in 40 miles or by taking a boat 50 miles to a landing and then being transported 11 miles up steep switchbacks in one of the village’s fleet of old schoolbuses.
