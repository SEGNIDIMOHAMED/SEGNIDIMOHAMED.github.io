title: How to remap Alfred file search hotkey
---
I type with Dvorak, and on that keyboard, the "z" key is where "/" normally is. A minor annoyance I've run into is that Alfred maps the file finder invocation to "⌘ + ⌥ + /", which, on my keyboard, then maps to "⌘ + ⌥ + z", and conflicts with the same hotkey in IntelliJ that's used for rolling back changes.

It's actually quite easy to remap, though. Just pop open Alfred preferences and change it here:
