title: Six essential Google Analytics metrics
---
I attended an excellent webinar on Google Analytics the other day hosted by Niel Robertson and Anna Sawyer from [Trada](http://trada.com/). Iâ€™ve been using some metrics in my custom reports similar to theirs for a couple of my clients, but they had a few very insightful ones that I jotted down and implemented immediately. The combined list is as follows:

1. Conversion Rate and Bounce Rate
2. Adwords Cost per Conversion
3. Conversions by Source
4. Conversion Rate by Source
5. Unique Visitor Conversions
6. Unique Visitor Conversion Rate
