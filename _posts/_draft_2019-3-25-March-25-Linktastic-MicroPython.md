## PyBoard D
![PyBoardD](https://store.micropython.org/media/products/PYBD_SF2_W4F2.jpg)
* The big news is, of course, **PyBoard D** is now for sale!
  * STM32F7 216MHz Cortex M7, 512KB internal flash, 256KB RAM, 2MB external flash, WiFi, Bluetooth, microSD, lots of GPIO (46+11), great peripheral support
  * Small (34x24mm) with well thought-through mech; mount on dense connectors or castellated or using pins
  * Three variants of the board, effectively with different MCU's
    * Some of the differences: single/double precision floats, USB, more RAM/flash
  * One of the best features: you can expect _exceptional_ support from Damien
