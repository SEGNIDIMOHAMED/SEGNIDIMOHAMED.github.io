title: Digital Minimalism Review
---
(This is adapted from a speech I'm going to give for Toastmasters that I thought I'd share here as well)

There is an episode of the 1960s era [Twilight Zone](https://www.crisismagazine.com/2016/happiness-and-hell-in-the-twilight-zone) in which a career criminal named Henry is killed in a shootout with police. He awakens in the afterlife in the presence of a smiling man who is wearing all white who guides him to a nearby casino. The casino is full of beautiful people, an abundance of delicious food, and a roulette wheel that always brings up Henry’s number. After a month of wining, dining, and winning, Henry becomes unbearably bored and remarks to the man, “if this is Heaven, I’d almost rather be in the other place.” The man replies, “This is the other place.”

In a sense, this is what 2019 is like. We find ourselves in a paradoxical time in which we have an abundance of connections to anyone in the world via our smartphones, yet simultaneously often a sense of emptiness, loneliness, and being overwhelmed. Recently, I read Cal Newport’s book, [“Digital Minimalism,”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) and I decided to rethink my relationship with technology. Newport emphasizes prioritizing fewer strong connections over many weaker ones with people in our lives, pursuing activities that require a deeper sense of focus, and generally being more mindful and intentional about our uses of technology. In this speech, I’ll discuss some of the problems I was trying to solve, how I went about solving them, and what the results were afterwards.

To start off with, hi, my name is David Merrick and I’m a technology addict. I would definitely classify myself as a “Digital Maximalist.” I spend at least 9 hours of a typical day in front of a screen just for work, and countless more in addition to that. I’m a rabid consumer of news and podcasts, and I almost always have something on in the background whether I’m at home or exercising or running errands. I’m an avid photographer and share a lot of my photos on social media. 

After reading “Digital Minimalism,” I realized that I was feeling completely overwhelmed and scattered. If a coworker sent me a Slack message at work, I would immediately drop whatever I was doing to look at it, and then I’d forget what I was working on previously. I am not immune to getting a sense of FOMO every time I look at my Facebook news feed. I was prone to spend a not insignificant amount of time preoccupied with how many people liked my latest post. During any downtime in my day, I engaged in tons of mindless scanning of CNN headlines, retweeting, and checking Gmail way too often. And yes, while spending time with a friend, I would sometimes pull out the phone at some point during the conversation. A consequence of all of this was that my brain never got a break. At the end of many days, I’d feel drained, even though it sometimes felt like I hadn’t done a lot that day. 

So, in essence, the problems I was trying to solve around my use of technology were as follows: I didn’t have clear boundaries around how quickly I would respond to messages, I was unsatisfied with my productivity at work, and I was feeling distracted and overwhelmed. I employed several strategies suggested in the book to address these and generally be more intentional with my use of technology. One suggestion that Newport makes is to do a “digital decluttering,” in which you aggressively cut out distracting technology from your life and add back only what’s useful. So I did. I deleted Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, and Twitter from my phone. I installed them on an iPad at home, so I could still use them if I felt a need to, but in a more controlled manner. I exported my Facebook events as a subscription in my calendar app, so I could still get the benefit of knowing when events I’d RSVPd for were happening without having to log in as often. I did keep Facebook messenger so that I could keep in contact with people--I was mostly just trying to avoid mindlessly skimming my News Feed. Another suggestion Newport makes is to batch up distracting activities. Instead of responding immediately to coworkers and text messages, I decided to batch those up at regular intervals. I came up with a contract with myself where I would respond to text messages within two hours, and Slack messages from coworkers within 30 minutes. The rest of the time, I put my phone and computer into Do Not Disturb mode, and I used a timer to remind me to check my messages every so often. Most of my coworkers are in the office, so if it’s genuinely an emergency they can just walk over to my desk. And the Do Not Disturb mode on my phone does allow calls from contacts through, so if someone does need to get ahold of me sooner they’re able to. 

These changes were all fairly recent, but I’m pleased so far with the results. I feel like I’m more productive, mindful, and present with people around me. Early on, I’d find myself wanting to know how many people liked a recent post I’d made, but then I’d remember that I didn’t have any social media apps on my phone. That pause was enough to give me room to realize that it didn’t matter. It’s amazing how easy it is to tame an impulse like that by just making things a little less accessible. Google did a recent study in which they found that employee consumption of M&Ms decreased by [3.1 million calories](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/google-crunches-data-on-munching-in-office/2013/09/01/3902b444-0e83-11e3-85b6-d27422650fd5_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.df0baa8668fe) when they just placed them in opaque containers. I do still log into Facebook, but once every few days on my computer and mostly just to check events. As for messages, I learned that probably 99% of things are not as much of an emergency as I was treating them. Not responding right away has allowed me to concentrate on what I’m doing for longer periods of time, and I’ve felt much more productive at work. This is anecdotal, of course, but at the end of the day lately I’ve felt more relaxed. 

In conclusion, the world is only getting more connected, not less. 5G networks are rolling out, Elon Musk is putting 12,000 Internet satellites into space as we speak, we all have more and more smart devices on our wrists and in our homes. There’s a lot of competition for our attention, and that’s only going to increase in the coming years. I’m glad I took the time to evaluate my relationship with technology, and while you don’t have to go to the extremes that I did, I encourage you to ask the same kinds of questions.
