In recent developments, reinforcement learning post-training is emerging as an effective and cost-efficient approach to enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities. Concurrently, significant discussions have arisen around diffusion models, which reportedly accelerate inference speeds by an order of magnitude.

## March 2025: AI Project Highlights

### Ollama: Efficient AI Backend

Since July 2024, **Ollama** has rapidly developed into a compelling backend solution for AI model deployment. While **vllm** remains popular in batch inference scenarios, Ollama distinguishes itself by natively supporting GGUF model formats, enabling versatile single-inference capabilities across various AI modalities (LLMs, Vision Models, VLMs, VLAs).

### Enhancing AI-Driven Coding

[**Fasten your AI coding workflow**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jj2ucr/i_completed_a_project_with_100_aigenerated_code/): An insightful experience shared on Reddit highlights a project executed entirely using AI-generated code, demonstrating the transformative impact of AI coding assistants.

Model choice affects code quality. Attention to user intent, response style, and accuracy can create a big mess quickly.

### Vibe Coding by Andrej Karpathy

> There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding," where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It's possible because the LLMs (e.g., Cursor Composer with Sonnet) are getting too good. Also, I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper...
