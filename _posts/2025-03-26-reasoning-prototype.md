Recent news in LLM sees reinforcement learning post-training as a cost effective way for reaching advanced capabilities. Also, lots of discussions about diffusion models that can speed-up inference by order of magnitude.

## March 2025: AI project storm

Ollama, a backend for running AI models is under active development since July 2024. The alternive, vllm is widely used in the community for batch inference. However, ollama ability to use GGUF format for models allows to natively run almost any kind of AI with very competitive performance under single inference (LLM, visions, VLMs, VLAs, etc.).

Chat3D, a french company based in France, Lyon that generate SOTA 3D models from text or image. Very worth checking out !

Be aware that models are different, in quality, attention to user intent and responses 'style'. For coding, this is a critical part as the response quality will directly influence your code quality for the better or the worse.

Andrej Karpath thoughts on vibe coding

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s a new kind of coding I call &quot;vibe coding&quot;, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists. It&#39;s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisperâ€¦</p>&mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
