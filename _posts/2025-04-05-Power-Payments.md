Imagine getting paid just for leaving your laptop plugged in. At GreenCloud, weâ€™re building a world where your everyday devices â€” laptops, phones, even TVs â€” can earn money while helping the planet.

Weâ€™re excited to share how it works and why it's a win-win for you and the environment.

## ðŸ”Œ Your Devices Already Use Power â€” Letâ€™s Make It Count

Weâ€™ve been testing devices like the **Apple M1 MacBook**, known for its power efficiency. When in use, it typically draws **10â€“20 watts**, but GreenCloud tasks donâ€™t need a screen, so the draw can be even lower.

Plugging your laptop into a **Shelly smart power plug** helps us measure the real-time energy use. With the screen off, background processing consumes far less power than watching videos or running a game.

On average:

- **Laptops** use 10â€“30W (MacBooks lean toward the lower end)
- **Phones** use 2â€“6W while active (less if idle and charging)
- **Smart TVs** can be used during idle time, drawing around 30â€“80W (depending on screen size and model)

## âš¡ The Tariff Talk â€” What Does This Cost You?

In the UK, energy tariffs vary, and many people are now on **variable rates** or **time-of-use tariffs** like **Octopus Agile** or **Economy 7**. Hereâ€™s how that plays out:

- **Standard tariff** (typical): ~28p per kWh
- **Off-peak Agile tariff**: as low as 7â€“12p per kWh
- **Solar-powered home**: potentially **free or surplus energy** during the day

Letâ€™s do the math for a **laptop running 10W for 8 hours a day**:
- 10W Ã— 8 hrs = 80Wh = 0.08kWh
- Cost per day: 0.08kWh Ã— 0.28p â‰ˆ **2.24p**
- Monthly cost: â‰ˆ **Â£0.67**
- Even cheaper if you're using off-peak or solar.

And youâ€™d earn **Â£5â€“Â£10/month**, meaning youâ€™re well into profit, even before thinking about multiple devices.

## ðŸ“± Add More Devices, Earn More

We support multiple devices per account. That could be:

- Your **laptop**, idling while plugged in
- A **spare phone**, charging on a shelf
- A **smart TV**, active when not in use

Each device increases your earnings potential â€” all while staying eco-friendly.

## ðŸŒ± Sustainable and Rewarding

This is about **distributed, carbon-free computing**. Your unused device time becomes a node in our global network, helping researchers, creators, and developers â€” all without spinning up a giant data center.

And we reward you for it.
