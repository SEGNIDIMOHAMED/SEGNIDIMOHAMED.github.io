title: How to securely share AWS keys
---
Need to share AWS keys securely with a coworker? Don't want to just paste them in Slack? [OneTimeSecret](https://onetimesecret.com/) is the way to go.

Simply paste in your secret, set a passphrase, set an expiration date, and then share the link and the passphrase with your coworker. After he or she loads the page, the key will self-destruct, Mission Impossible-style.
