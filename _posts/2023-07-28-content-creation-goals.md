It feels like it has been ages since I last wrote on my blog. Over the last few months, I've had dips where I've not created much content, or I've posted it directly on The Club, instead of on my personal blog. It's OK to take a break, but now I want to get back into it.

So I don't need to come up with topics from scratch every time I want to put something new out, I'm making a plan. You know I mean business when I say, I've created a spreadsheet, everyone loves a good spreadsheet, right?

I've come up with a number of Themes, and even some draft titles for content I want to post this year. I've also planned a cadence, however fast I write, I'm going to aim to publish 1 post a week, maximum. This should you to consume my content consistently, as I produce it as I have capacity.

I'll also check back in off-cycle at some point, and let you know how I'm getting on. Wish me luck. Oh and you'll still find me over on the [Ministry of Testing Club](https://club.ministryoftesting.com/ "Ministry of Testing - The Club"), where I might try out some of my content or ask questions ahead of time.

Updated to say, I'm a little ahead of schedule, and I couldn't resist posting my first new blog early!
