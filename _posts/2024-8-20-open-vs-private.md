This competitive pressure is driving an unprecedented acceleration in AI innovation across the board.

Github stars generally reflect the reach and popularity of a project to its audience. The open-source projects Whisper, ComfyUI, OpenWeb-UI, Ollama (TOP 80 github stars), Langchain (TOP 80 github stars) grew at a pace unmatch by any closed source projects.

The number of Github stars for closed-source projects appears to be stabilizing after a while as the interest of the community.

## Good shot, Meta ! (y)

Meta, the tech giant is behind the remarkable Llama series of language models.
