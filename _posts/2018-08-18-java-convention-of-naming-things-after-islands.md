title: Java convention of naming things after islands
---
I'm currently reading [Kotlin in Action](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1617293296/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), and stumbled across a passage that I found interesting:

> Kotlin is named after an island near St. Petersburg, Russia, where most of the Kotlin development team is located. In using an island name, we followed the precedent established by Java and Ceylon, but we decided to go for something closer to our homes.

I hadn't previously been aware of this precedent. I hunted around, and wasn't able to find this explicitly documented anywhere. However, I did find a few frameworks, libraries, and tools that do follow this convention, including:
- [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/): A Java library named after the Indonesian island of [Lombok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombok).
- [Jakarta EE](https://jakarta.ee/): A working group for Cloud Native Java, named after the Indonesian island of [Jakarta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta). There was previously an Apache project named [Jakarta](http://jakarta.apache.org/) that was ultimately retired in 2011.
- [Ceylon](https://ceylon-lang.org/): A language named after the island that is now known as [Sri Lanka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_Ceylon). 
- [Komodo](https://www.activestate.com/komodo-ide): An IDE named after the Indonesian island of [Komodo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komodo_(island).

I'll add more as I find them, and let me know in the comments if you're aware of any others.
