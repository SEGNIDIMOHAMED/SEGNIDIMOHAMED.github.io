title: How to cleanly merge panorama photos in Photoshop
---
Sometimes, after doing a Photomerge in Photoshop (File -> Automate -> Photomerge), you end up with a panorama that looks like this:

![1.jpg]({{site.cdn_path}}/2014/08/22/1.jpg)

Never fear, these images can be more cleanly blended. Select all the layers, then click Edit -> Autoblend layers. Make sure the "Seamless Tones and Colors" box is checked.
