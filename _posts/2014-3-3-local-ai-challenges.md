As AI services proliferate, companies and individuals are faced with a complex web of providers, microservices, and terms of use. This landscape poses significant risks to security and privacy, making it essential to rethink our approach to AI development and deployment.

**The Hidden Dangers of AI Services**
-------------------------------------

When we integrate AI tools into our workflows, they can become vulnerable to activity spying, which can be easily exploited by attackers. The potential malicious uses of private data passed to cloud AI systems are alarming, including:

* Theft of personal information
* Work behavior and responsibility monitoring
* Intellectual property risks
* Enhanced social engineering cyberattacks

**Inadequate Security Measures**
------------------------------

While measures like anonymous sessions, encrypted data, no-data-save policies, and end-to-end encrypted communications are crucial, they are insufficient to protect us against malicious uses. For instance:

* Anonymous sessions can be compromised if the data contains personal information
* Encrypted data can still be vulnerable if the system is compromised
* No-data-save policies may decrease the value of AI systems for many tasks that require iterations


**The Power of Local AI Systems**
------------------------------

"BE LOCAL (and open !)" is a mantra that is changing the way we approach AI development and deployment.

By keeping AI systems local, we can significantly reduce the risk of data leakage and confidentiality breaches. Sensitive information will not be transmitted to an obscur third-party, where it can be intercepted or accessed by unattended parties.

**The Hardware Challenge**
-------------------------

Currently, an AI system requires a significant investment, with professional equipment costing around $5,000. 
However, as AI systems develop and computation becomes a standard for modern computers, it will become easier to run local AI systems at a lower cost. Prices are likely to drop by a factor of two every two years for the same amount of performance.

While the benefits of local AI systems are clear, their development requires financial support from transparent and independent organizations. The open-source community for local AI development needs resources to build great, secure local AI systems.

**Conclusion**
--------------

The development of secure AI systems is a pressing concern that requires immediate attention.

By promoting local AI systems, we can create a more resilient and secure ecosystem that benefits individuals, organizations, and communities alike.

Our approach to AI deployment requires a careful analysis to our needs in order to put the security and privacy at the forefront of these new systems.
