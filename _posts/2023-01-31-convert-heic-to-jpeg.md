title: How to quickly convert HEIC to JPEG in macOS
---

HEIC has been the default format for iOS photos since 2011.

It's all well and good, but I frequently find myself needing to convert
to JPEG because HEIC isn't allowed in some web forms.

I realized today that macOS has a built-in right-click extension action
which does this.

Right-click your HEIC file. Select Quick Actions -> Convert Image.

Select the image quality you want.

And voil√†. A shiny new JPEG appears.
