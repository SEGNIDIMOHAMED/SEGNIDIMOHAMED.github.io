## News Round-up

### Headlines

#### MicroPython v1.23 Release

![MPLogo](../images/logos/mplogo.png)

On the last day of May, [v1.23 was
released](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/releases/tag/v1.23.0)!

Featuring dynamic USB devices, OpenAMP support, huge improvements to webassembly
and much, *much* more.

However, development of MicroPython rarely pauses, and the [v1.24
milestone](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/milestone/7) already
contains some exciting features!

#### ViperIDE

![ViperIDE](../images/2024-06/viperide.png)

Volodymyr Shymanskyy, co-founder of [Blynk](https://blynk.io/), released
[ViperIDE](https://github.com/vshymanskyy/ViperIDE).

It's a browser-based IDE designed to work with MicroPython. It leverages WebUSB
and WebBluetooth to establish connections to a device and uses the usual
protocols from mpremote for file transfers. It's also got a built-in mip-based
package manager and a live REPL.

While generally pretty great, it's a *particularly fantastic* tool on Chromebooks
where it's often not possible to install packages.

[Try it out](https://viper-ide.org/)!

Les Pounder from [Tom's Hardware also interviewed
Volodymyr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owDVI7z5GAk) about ViperIDE - but
they also covered Blynk and an as-yet-unreleased library to connect MicroPython
devices to Blynk.

If there's enough interest we may consider running a MicroPython Development
Sprint around the time of the event. Let me know if you're interested!

#### Teardown 2024

![Teardown 2024](../images/2024-06/teardown2024.png)

[Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/)'s Teardown is an annual conference "about the practice and the art
of hardware...".

As he shared in a [Discussion
post](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15243), Ned Konz ~~is
giving~~ gave a talk of particular interest to us: [Prototype to product with
MicroPython: faster and happier embedded systems
development](https://www.crowdsupply.com/teardown/portland-2024/long-talk/prototype-to-product-with-micropython-faster-and-happier-embedded-systems-development)

Videos from Teardown aren't yet published but Ned's slides looked great!

#### Programming ESP32: Learn MicroPython Coding and Electronics [book]

![Programming ESP32](../images/2024-06/progesp32book.png)

[Dr Simon Monk](https://simonmonk.org/) has released [Programming ESP32: Learn
MicroPython Coding and Electronics](https://simonmonk.org/esp32).

Currently it's available on Amazon but Dr Monk's [blog
announcement](https://www.doctormonk.com/2024/06/new-book-on-esp32-and-micropython.html)
indicates that it'll soon also be released on [MonkMakes](https://monkmakes.com/).

[Hot tip: The Amazon link on the blog post doesn't allow purchases in Australia,
but Dr Monk was kind enough to source a [different link that we can use Down
Under](https://www.amazon.com.au/Programming-ESP32-MicroPython-Coding-Electronics/dp/1739487451/)!]

At the same blog post he also discusses his decision to use Thonny and the
specific ESP32 boards used in the book. All the example code used in the book
[is available](https://github.com/simonmonk/prog_esp32).

#### micropython-bleradio

![BLE Radio](../images/2024-06/bleradiopybricks.png)

[Laurens Valk announced](https://fosstodon.org/@laurensvalk/112553130854602227)
that he'd released a lightweight library -
[micropython-bleradio](https://github.com/pybricks/micropython-bleradio/) to
perform simple but low-level BLE comms. Uses only the BLE advertising packet,
takes care to embed data in *very few* bytes.

#### MPDisplay

![MPDisplay](../images/2024-06/mpdisplay_hinch.gif)

Brad Barnett has been doing some *fantastic* work with his GUI library
[MPDisplay](https://github.com/bdbarnett/mpdisplay). Read - and get involved
with! - [his discussion
post](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15261) that introduces
MPDisplay.

From the post:

"MPDisplay is a display and event driver that works on CPython, CircuitPython
and MicroPython. It enables you to develop your app's UI on your deskop and the
code immediately transfers to your microcontroller!"

Brad has been looking to bridge the MicroPython and LVGL worlds but this library
appears to be even more ambitious!

#### Tim plays movies..and releases bitgraphics

Tim Hanewich has been looking at ways [of rendering monochrome
videos](https://x.com/TimHanewich/status/1801400923370963410) efficiently on the
venerable - and very cheap - SSD-1306 OLED displays.

![bitgraphics](../images/2024-06/bitgraphics.png)

Tim has been keeping busy it seems; he's also released
[bitgraphics](https://github.com/TimHanewich/bitgraphics), a MicroPython module
for displaying images, text and other graphics on the SSD-1306. It's a bit like
dialing framebuf up to 11.

#### RISC-V QEMU port and emitter

Alessandro Gatti has been doing some interesting work with RISC-V.

[Add a RISC-V RV32IMC native code
emitter](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/15231)

[Add RISC-V 32 bit QEMU
port](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/12853)

#### When a Mongoose met a MicroPython

Excellent write-ups on how to integrate Cesanta's embedded C MQTT library

[Part 1](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1649.php)
[Part 2](https://www.embeddedrelated.com/showarticle/1670.php)

#### Framebuf for the Console

![Framebuf for Console](../images/2024-06/bitgraphics_paw.jpg)

Owen Carter
[announced](https://fosstodon.org/@easytarget@social.makerforums.info/112660490256467490)
a framebuf driver for REPL console use. His [discussion
post](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15327) has more details;
it allows you to render output that would normally go to a display to the
console instead. Handy! We've started discussing extending the idea...

#### MicroPython for the TC32

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sv58aPvIonw?si=VW2eribgqjD-Rtv7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

[David Given ports MicroPython to a $3 Aliexpress-bought
watch](https://github.com/orgs/micropython/discussions/15333). I think the first
line sets the scene: "I have a new watch. It's terrible."

It uses an obscure micro, the Telink TLSR8232. 512KB flash (good!) but 16KB RAM
(ouch, tight!).

His video also made it [to the front page of Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40769882). [Twitter
announcement](https://x.com/hjalfi/status/1804892354244923882)

#### ESP32-C6 port

![ESP32-C6](../images/2024-06/esp32-c6-overview.png)

Update: AndrewL resolved the last known issue; ADC's are fixed for the C6.

One feature of the C6 that I'd neglected to notice; although it's a relatively
affordable device, Espressif included support for [CAN
(TWAI)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32c6/api-reference/peripherals/twai.html).

#### Other board definitions

I've been trying to backfill MicroPython board definitions for devices I've
purchased...

- [M5Stack Dial](https://github.com/mattytrentini/micropython/tree/add-m5stack-dial-board)
- [M5Stack DIN Meter](https://github.com/mattytrentini/micropython/tree/add-m5stack-din-meter)
- Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 (PR #[14402](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/pull/14402/))

Again, please test if you can! Reach out if you need help building.

### Projects

#### Caravan motor home leveler

![Caravan motor home leveler](../images/2024-06/sitstand.png)

Luc Volders has been building a caravan/motor-home leveler with a six-part blog write-up!

[Part 2 covers the MicroPython software](http://lucstechblog.blogspot.com/2024/05/caravanmotor-home-leveler-part-2.html).

#### Ultimate Open Source Smart Sit-Stand Desk

![Sit stand desk](../images/2024-06/sitstand.png)

[Walid has built a smart sit-stand
desk](https://x.com/waliori/status/1796291807908700511) based on a broken,
manual IKEA desk. All the [MicroPython firmware is
available](https://github.com/waliori/RP-pico-sit-stand-firmware) and Walid
would love feedback on it.

This was a *beautiful* build, Walid has clearly put a lot of time and effort
into it and has put together a stunning video of the construction, from start to
finish:

### Final Thoughts

#### Meetup alternative?

![Meetup Bad](../images/2024-06/meetup_bad.png)

Meetup has disappointed me one too many times! Anyone have any good
alternatives?

#### How to train simple AIs to balance a double pendulum

An *excellent* video from [Pezzza's Work](https://www.youtube.com/@PezzzasWork)
that explains how to train a neural network to balance a double pendulum.

Although an ideal ML application, before I watched the video I wouldn't have
been *entirely* sure it would be *possible* to balance a double pendulum using
this method; they're inherently very chaotic! Spoiler alert: It is, and now I
can't help but wonder if a 3x (or 10x pendulum? 1000x??) is possible...

It would be *fascinating* trying to build this with MicroPython and seeing how
the real world would affect performance.
