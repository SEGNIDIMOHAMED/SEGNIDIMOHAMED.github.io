title: 'Weekend Project: Bluetooth headphones for the TV'
---
My weekend project was getting Bluetooth headphones working with the TV (My girlfriend isn't a fan of the living room "turning into a warzone" during my occasional PlayStation sessions). I picked up this [TaoTronics transmitter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KO1JNCA/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it did the job well. It paired easily and then all I had to do was just plug it into the receiver's headphone jack.
