title: Hillsboro Airplane home drone flight
---
This weekend, I finally got a chance to take some drone shots of the [Hillsboro airplane home](http://www.oregonlive.com/hg/index.ssf/2016/04/airplane_home_hillsboro_portla.html). It's been on my bucket list forever to do this, and it was just as cool to see as I'd thought it would be. I'm curious now to schedule a tour and see what it looks like on the inside.
