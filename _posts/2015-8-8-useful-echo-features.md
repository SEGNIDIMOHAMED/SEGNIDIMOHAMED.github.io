I purchased an Amazon Echo recently and am writing this post to catalog useful features I've discovered with it.

1. Use it as a Bluetooth speaker.

Say "Alexa, pair bluetooth device" to put the Echo in pairing mode. On your device, find the Echo and pair with it. Play music, profit.

2. Set the volume.

The volume can be set to values between 1 and 10.

Simply say, "Alexa, volume [number between 1 and 10]" to change the volume.

3. Play the radio.

"Alexa, play [radio station]"

4. Flip a coin

"Alexa, flip a coin"
