title: Reversing A Router's Firmware!
---
To get started, we want to get access to the device's firmware. To do so, a simple google search will lead to DLink-Russia's website which opens a small database of firmwares of their devices ready for user to use to update the firmware of their own devices.

Since my own router is the "simple" DIR-825 

```bash
 ~/De/programming2/dlink-retest  binwalk ./fw.bin                          ✔

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION

```

The first thing I jumped to to check is the filesystem:
after `unsquatch`ing it we can browse the filesystem. At first, I was looking for the `www` folder or something similar but couldn't find it, so I performed a simple `find` to discover HTML files in the filesystem:

```
 ~/De/p/dlink-r/_/squashfs-root  find . -name "*.html"                     ✔
./usr/share/xupnpd/ui/ui_main.html
./usr/share/xupnpd/ui/ui_config.html
./usr/share/xupnpd/ui/ui_template.html
./usr/share/xupnpd/www/index.html
./usr/share/transmission/web/index.html
./srv/anweb/browser_check/build/eng/bad.html
./srv/anweb/browser_check/build/eng/old.html
./srv/anweb/browser_check/build/rus/bad.html
./srv/anweb/browser_check/build/rus/old.html
./srv/anweb/apps/trouble/index.html
./srv/anweb/apps/trouble/templates/body.tpl.html
```

After browsing and cross-referceing with the running router I have in my possesion, it does seem that these files are served as a part of the web portal of the router.

Now I want to look for the binary that handles it, I would expect something like `apache` to reside somewhere in the system but no such thing was found. So I've decided to look into this "anweb" thing, let's see what else can we find about this in the filesystem:

```
 ~/De/p/dlink-r/_/squashfs-root  find . -name "anweb"                      ✔
./usr/sbin/anweb
./srv/anweb
```
Besides the directory at `/srv/anweb` which we already know about, there's a binary `anweb`. 

```
 ~/De/p/dlink-r/_/squashfs-root  file ./usr/sbin/anweb                     ✔
./usr/sbin/anweb: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 rel2 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped
```

Great! Let's load this binary in Ghidra and analyze it.
