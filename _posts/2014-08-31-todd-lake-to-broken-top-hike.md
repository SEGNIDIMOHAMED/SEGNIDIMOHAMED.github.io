title: Todd Lake to Broken Top hike
---
On Friday, I hiked from Todd Lake to Broken Top with my sister. We'd read about the hike in Virginia Meissner's Central Oregon hiking guidebook, and thought it looked scenic. It certainly did not disappoint. For most of the first and last 6 miles, there is a great view of Mt. Bachelor. At the turnaround point, there is a gorgeous glacial lake and a ridge that provides incredible views of the Three Sisters mountains as well as Mt. Jefferson and Mt. Hood. If you start at Todd Lake, the hike is 14 miles round trip with just over 700 feet of elevation gain. The distance can be shortened by driving on a rough road to the Broken Top crater trailhead. The clearance on our car was minimal, so we took the longer route. The hike has become more popular due to an article in the newspaper recently, so expect to see several people on the trails.
