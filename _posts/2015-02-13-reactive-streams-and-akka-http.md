Just returned from excellent meetup [Reactive Streams & Akka HTTP by Mathias Doenitz](http://www.meetup.com/Scala-Berlin-Brandenburg/events/219753897/) in
Berlin.

It was interesting talk by Mathias [@sirthias](https://twitter.com/sirthias), author of [spray](http://spray.io/)
Presentation currently available only [for Vienna](http://spray.io/vienna/) but, hopefully will be also available [Berlin](http://spray.io/berlin/)
version. But anyway, they are the same except of first presentation page (specifically - date and city)
