title: Olympic Beach Backpacking
---
This past weekend, some friends and I backpacked along the beaches of the Olympic National Park, in northern Washington. We were originally planning on going [this route](http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Ozette_to_Rialto_Beach_Hike), but the slick rocks and stormy weather made that untenable. We ended up camping one night near Cape Johnson, then heading back to Rialto Beach.

The first day was sunny, and I shot a bunch of photos of the scenery which I uploaded [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/42873456@N02/albums/72157683025429495).
