title: Olympic Beach Backpacking

This past weekend, some friends and I backpacked along the beaches of the Olympic National Park, in northern Washington. We were originally planning on going [this route](http://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Ozette_to_Rialto_Beach_Hike), but the slick rocks and stormy weather made that untenable. We ended up camping one night near Cape Johnson, then heading back to Rialto Beach.
