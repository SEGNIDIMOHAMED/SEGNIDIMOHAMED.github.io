title: Revisiting Vietnam after 23 years
---
In October 2000, when I was 11 years old, my parents, younger sister, and I flew to Da Nang, Vietnam, to adopt my
youngest sister, Julie. Traveling there was the first time any of us had been overseas, and it was a life-changing,
eye-opening experience. Nearly 23 years later, I decided to return there for a month on a work sabbatical. My
girlfriend, Nicole, is joining for 16 days of the trip. My mom also dug up my and my sister Lisa’s journals from that
trip during a recent visit home, and it’s been fun to revisit those.

I’ve got a huge mix of thoughts swirling in my brain about the trip. Firstly, I’m incredibly excited to explore the
central and northern part of the country. Our trip in 2000 was more abbreviated by necessity, and we were somewhat
limited in our activities with a new toddler in tow. We primarily visited Da Nang and Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon)
. Hoi An was my favorite place we visited on a day trip, and I remember wanting more time there. Nicole and I are going
to spend the better part of a week there and visit the [Mỹ Sơn ruins](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/949/) that date
from the Champa Kingdom in the 4th century. We’re also very much looking forward to taking boats around Ha Long Bay.

I reached out to the adoption agency to try to make contact with Julie’s birth mother while I’m there. It’s always been
a mystery to us who she is and what her life has been like. There are no guarantees that we’ll be able to get in touch,
but I wanted to make a best effort. I know Julie has a lot of complex feelings about the adoption, so I checked in with
her first, and am being conscientious about the level of engagement she wants in the process.

I’ve been reading a few books lately on the subject of adoption and highly recommend [Somewhere Sisters](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/59891842) by Erika
Hayasaki. She captures so many of the complexities of the adoption experience and provides a lot of history of the
politics of Vietnamese/American adoption. The Harvard Book Store recently hosted
an [insightful conversation with her and sociologist Indigo Willing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1_Z4H6DllU) that I
also recommend. On that topic, it’s an especially interesting time with domestic politics so focused on abortion. The
right side of the political spectrum views adoption as a solution to the debate, when in reality it’s much, much more
complicated than that.

Geopolitically, it’s a pretty turbulent time to visit SE Asia. North Korea
keeps [hurling ballistic missiles](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-missile-into-sea-off-east-coast-south-korea-says-2023-04-12/)
off the
peninsula, China/Taiwan tensions are probably the highest they’ve ever been, and wildfires in Burma, Thailand, and Laos
have given the region some
of [the worst air on the planet](https://www.thestar.com.my/aseanplus/aseanplus-news/2023/03/28/alarm-spreads-over-out-of-control-forest-fires-in-laos)
the past two months. If I’ve learned anything after three
years of pandemic/inflation/supply chain snarls, it’s that you can’t take travel for granted anymore. So even with a
sprinkle of trepidation from perpetually overconsuming the news, I’m grateful to be able to make the trip.
