Whether computer game characters reflect the ethnic diversity of global gaming communities; is this something that I've thought much about? No, I can't say that I have, but with the advent of VR gaming, I imagine that these issues will require much more thought and attention.

For most of my early gaming life, game protagonists were largely seem from a third person's perspective: either from the top or side. Controlling the likes of Mario wasn't much different to controlling a robot; it wasn't me doing the running and jumping, I was making this Mario character do all this, using a control pad.

Even when first person shooters like Doom came along, the site of an imposing CRT monitor and a hulking great PC tower was always a clear indicator of the distance between player and character. Moreover, a pixelated white face of an agonised 'Doomguy' reinforced this sense of controlling someone else.

Whether Mario, Doomguy or indeed some blond haired Persian Prince, the skin colour of these characters weren't any more important than that of movie or television characters; it never felt personal.

With the unparalleled levels of immersion now possible in VR, however, these issues are thrust upon us, almost literally, 'in our faces'. When using your simulated hands to bring virtual food towards our mouths, one has to actively resist from instinctively opening our mouths! 

The form, texture and colour that these simulated hands take, therfore, become a concern of some importance.
