Have I ever thought about 'inclusivity', whether computer game characters reflect the diversity of global gaming communities?

No, I can't say that I have given it much thought: for most of my early gaming life, game protagonists were viewed, from a third person perspective; controlling Mario wasn't much different to controlling a robot; I wasn't doing the running and jumping, I was making this Mario character do all this, using a control pad.

Even when first person shooters like Doom came along, site of an imposing CRT monitor and a hulking great PC tower was always a clear reminder of the distance between player and character. Moreover, a pixelated white face of an agonised 'Doomguy' reinforced this sense of controlling someone else.

Female game characters have always been few and far between and a busty Lara Croft didn't help the feminist cause either. 

Whether Mario, Doomguy, Lara or indeed some blond haired Persian Prince, the skin colour of these characters weren't any more important than that of movie or television characters; it never felt personal.

With the unparalleled levels of immersion now possible in VR, however, these issues are brought, literally, 'in your face'. When using your simulated hands to bring simulated towards your mouth, the urge to them open your mouth is hard to resist. The form, texture and colour these simulated hands should be given some thought
