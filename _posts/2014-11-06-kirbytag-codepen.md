I recently installed the overhauled [Kirby 2](http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-2) CMS to see whats new. The extension that previously allowed me to embed CodePen examples in my blog no longer functioned, so I created one based on [Kirbytext Codepen by ClementRoy](https://gist.github.com/ClementRoy/5024929) for Kirby 1.

## Get the extension

[Codepen extension for Kirby 2](https://github.com/plfstr/kirbytag-codepen)

_Download the files and then follow the readme instructions. Sorry, not compatible with Kirby 1._

## Features

By default enables you to embed a Pen result, with the default theme, 350 pixels height.
	
**The kirbytag extension allows you to override defaults to specify:**

*	**Pen height** - specified as plain numerical value i.e. 500 = 500px.
*	**Pen type** - the tab displayed i.e. html, css or result by default.
*	**Pen class** - wrap the Pen iframe in a presentational CSS class.
*	**Pen theme** - a `$theme` variable in `codepen.php` can be amended to specify an embed theme.

I recommend you read the full [readme](https://github.com/plfstr/kirbytag-codepen) on GitHub for more detailed instruction of the project.
