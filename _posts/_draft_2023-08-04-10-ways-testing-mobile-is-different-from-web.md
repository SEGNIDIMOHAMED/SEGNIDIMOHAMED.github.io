## 1 Hardware

Web runs on almost any device from a games console to a tricked out multi-core desktop PC with a huge high resolution screen. In contrast, mobile apps typically run on Android, iOS or both across many generations of mobile phones, tablets and smart watches.

Locally running simulators and hosted device farms do exist, and can be very helpful to get device coverage. However really test the user experience of mobile apps, having physical devices is a huge advantage, although it can get expensive fast.

## 2 Automation

## 3 Accessibility

## 4 Running locally
