* The [SiPeed MAIX MMU is now working](https://twitter.com/SipeedIO/status/1112336713584660480)
  * It allows the new dual-core RISC-V microcontroller to access large memory banks, treating secondary storage as RAM
  * Makes it even possible to run Linux on the device...
* Sipeed also released a couple of MicroPython MaixPy demos - [face detection](https://twitter.com/SipeedIO/status/1109508131812343808) and [MNIST number detection](https://twitter.com/SipeedIO/status/1109411295890030592)  
* Seeed [announced](https://twitter.com/seeedstudio/status/1110734906328440832) that they are building a RPi Hat with the Sipeed MAIX at the heart and are collecting community feedback about the design

## Dadamachines Doppler

* Smoosh together a SAMD51 M4 Microcontroller and a Lattice ICE40 FPGA together and you get the [Doppler](http://www.electronics-lab.com/dadamachines-doppler-new-fpga-platform-open-music-hardware/)
  * Designed for exploring music hardware
  * Doesn't yet run Python on the micro but it's only a matter of time...
