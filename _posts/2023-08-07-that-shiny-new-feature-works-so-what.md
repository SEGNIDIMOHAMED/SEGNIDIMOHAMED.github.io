## What does it mean, to say your feature is complete?

In software delivery teams I've worked in, we have often been responsible for parts of products. Sometimes this means we have been responsible for one or more services, and nothing beyond the responsibility of that service. Other times, the team has been responsible for a vertical stripe of functionality that crosses one or more backend services and the frontend that goes with it.

In almost all cases, we haven't been responsible for the whole system at once, the responsibility has been split up across multiple teams in some way. This means there has been times the team I've been in has declared a feature as complete, and then handed it over to another team. And the other way, our team has had to handle features implemented by other teams, that now change the product our services of features operate in.

All this means, that the concept of complete exists within the boundaries of responsibility, and it can mean different things to different people. So, when do we stop testing? When "out bit" is done? When the feature is available to customers? When we start collecting and analysing the first days, week, months worth of tracking data?

I find it very valuable to explore what complete means for the team I'm in, and to communicate this concept of completeness for us, and see how that fits with other teams who work on the same product. Inevitability, releases have gone better when the relationship between the teams has been strong, and we've worked together to avoid hard hand-off's, or "throw it over the wall". 

## So what does this mean in context of the whole product?

So, your feature is complete. Time to celebrate, are ship parties still a thing? But wait, does this mean the value has been delivered? I've recently been working in a team that relies on the efforts of another team to release a new version of our mobile app, including all the other features that are going into the release, before users get their hands on our efforts. If they they are prevented from releasing for any reason, tough luck, our changes won't get out yet.

OK so it isn't so bad waiting for another team before our code gets into the hands of customers, typically they ship every 2 weeks, and if anything we are often not ready for them and 

## Now what can you do next to make it a success?
