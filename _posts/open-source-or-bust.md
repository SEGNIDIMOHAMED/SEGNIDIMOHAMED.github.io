$34 billion! That is what Big Blue (IBM) has put forward earlier this week, to acquire the world's most prominent open source company, Red Hat. That is a massive vote of confidence. So, as long time open source advocate, I'm going to be really mature about this blow a huge raspberry at all the detractors who have for years dismissed the open source model as a 'fad' that delivers nothing but poor quality, insecure and legally dubious products. You all were so wrong; deal with it!

In fact, I'm going to stick my neck out with a wee prediction: over the next decade, technology companies that don't invest in building collaborative communities around their products, will become a dying breed. This is not about marketing, it's not about tacking on buzzwords whilst otherwise carrying on as usual: it's about survival. Nokia found this out the hard way, when it was effectively wiped out by increasingly tough competition in the form of Google's open source Android operating system. Microsoft  didn't get too far on the mobile front for similar reasons. Nokia of course eventually did open up their Symbian operating system, but only when the game was already over.

Back in 2001, when then Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer described Linux, the open source UNIX based operating system, with [C-words](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it/) the frustration was somewhat understandable. Having besieged Netscape, and looking like the winner of the 'browser wars,' Microsoft faced a number of new threats. Firstly, its web browser dominance was called into question, leading to costly legal battles. Secondly, with the release of Netscape Communicator's source code, leading to Mozilla's powerful Firefox browser, Microsoft's total dominance on this front was far from guaranteed. But fast forward to 2016 and Microsoft presented,  what could be seen as, the greatest about-turn in technology history, by announcing that it now 'loves' Linux and open source. Indeed, under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft has taken a number of key initiatives that puts weight behind these positive sentiments. The recent $7.5 billion dollar acquisition of Github, the world's largest open source repository, is just the latest in a series of love bombs.

Even Apple is increasingly developing an open source strategy. Earlier this year the Cupertino giant released the kernel source code of its desktop and mobile operating systems (macOS and iOS), on GitHub, of all places! What the heck is going on?

Open source offers many advantages over proprietary solutions, but innovation and quality, rather than cost, are amongst the primary reasons for its massive impact on technology. Of the most exciting tech trends -- such as blockchain, VR, big data analytics, machine learning, IOT and all that -- open source tools have played a leading role in their development. This is exactly the reason why Tesla Motors removed a load of its patents and started releasing the source code for the software that runs its cars! Therein lies a strong reason why the future belongs to the open production models: society has come to expect rapid technological progress and there isn't currently anything that can compete with masses of enthusiasts willing to utilise precious free time helping solve problems at no apparent cost. Whether through helping test early software builds, providing tech support or indeed actually help fix bugs, it's simply not feasible to employ thousands of QA testers, tech support personnel or programmers in-house -- and that too for a single product! Moreover, with the product community spread out all around the world, there's also the diversity of thought, environment and user experience that simply can't be replicated in some 'head office.'

So, what actually motivates volunteers and how are these loyal communities built? Well, it requires some investment: these people aren't really working for free; there's always a quid pro quo! A few things can help build an army of volunteers: 
- The project must have a vision or story that's [worth contributing towards](https://www.blender.org/foundation/). Even doing something truely cutting edge might be enough to get people rallying around your product: the Apple and Tesla fanbois are a case in point.
- Providing tools that can be used entirely, or partly, free of charge -- and more importantly -- tools that users are free to tinker with and modify. There's nothing that gives hobbyists energy more than the freedom to play with the innards of machines and software.
- Ensure that your project has some decent [starter documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html) that's easy to read and attractive. This will provide the initial intrigue and curiosity. By all means have the more comprehensive documentation available too, if it's there, but some slick graphic design and easy to read typesetting goes a long way.
- Once your have all of the above then it's just the case of putting some marketing bucks behind the project: social media campaigns, [workshops and seminars](https://2018.pyconuk.org/), competitions etc.
- Once a community for your product/project comes into existence, it's important that it's nurtured. Volunteers want to feel loved and appreciated.

But how do companies afford this sort of investment and how is it profitable? Well, it's increasingly becoming the case where a lack of investment in community building could easily render your product irrelevant and therefore: can companies afford not to engage in this way?
