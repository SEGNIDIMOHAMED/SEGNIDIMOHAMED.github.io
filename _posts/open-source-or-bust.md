$34 billion! That is what Big Blue (IBM) has put forward earlier this week, to acquire the world's most prominent open source company, Red Hat. That is a massive vote of confidence. So, as long time open source advocate, I'm going to be really mature about this blow a huge raspberry at all the detractors who have for years dismissed the open source model as a 'fad' that delivers nothing but poor quality, insecure and legally dubious products. You all were so wrong; deal with it!

In fact, I'm going to stick my neck out with a prediction: over the next decade, technology companies that don't invest in building collaborative communities around their products, will become a dying breed. This is not about marketing, it's not about tacking on buzzwords whilst otherwise carrying on as usual: it's about survival. Nokia found this out the hard way, when it was effectively wiped out by increasingly tough competition in the form of Google's open source Android OS. Microsoft  didn't get too far on the mobile front for similar reasons. Nokia eventually did open up their Symbian operating system, but only when the game was already over.

Back in 2001, when then Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer described Linux, the open source UNIX based operating system, with [C-words](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it/) the frustration was somewhat understandable. Having besieged Netscape, and looking like the winner of the 'browser wars,' Microsoft faced a number of new threats. Firstly, its web browser dominance was called into question, leading to costly legal battles. Secondly, with the release of Netscape Communicator's source code, leading to Mozilla's powerful Firefox browser, Microsoft's total dominance on this front was far from guaranteed. But fast forward to 2016 and Microsoft presented,  what could be seen as, the greatest about-turn in technology history, by announcing that it now 'loves' Linux and open source. Indeed, under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft has taken a number of key initiatives that puts weight behind these positive sentiments. The recent $7.5 billion dollar acquisition of Github, the world's largest open source repository, is just the latest in a series of love bombs.

Even Apple is increasingly developing an open source strategy. Earlier this year the Cupertino giant released the kernel source code of its desktop and mobile operating systems (macOS and iOS), on GitHub, of all places! What the heck is going on?

Open source offers many advantages over proprietary solutions, but innovation and quality, rather than cost, are amongst the primary reasons for its massive impact on technology. Of the most exciting tech trends -- such as blockchain, VR, big data analytics, machine learning, IOT and all that -- open source tools have played a leading role in their development. This is exactly the reason why Tesla Motors removed a load of its patents and started [releasing the source code](https://www.zdnet.com/article/tesla-starts-to-release-its-cars-open-source-linux-software-code/) for the software that runs its cars!

Therein lies a strong reason why the future belongs to the open production models: society has come to expect rapid technological progress and there isn't currently anything that can compete with masses of enthusiasts willing to utilise precious free time helping solve problems, at no apparent cost. Whether through helping test early software builds, providing tech support or indeed actually help fix bugs, it's simply not feasible to employ thousands of QA testers, tech support personnel or programmers in-house -- and that too for a single product! Moreover, with the product community spread out all around the world, there's also the diversity of thought and user experience that simply can't be replicated in some 'head office.'

Demographic changes and skills shortages in the US and Europe will likely accelerate this process. Technology companies will find it increasingly difficult to hire the right talent in-house and will have no choice but to explore other development models, including open source. Particularly at a time when the strategy of opening up economies to greater levels of immigration is falling out of favour.

So, what actually motivates volunteers and how are these loyal communities built? Well, it requires some investment: these people aren't really working for free; there's always a quid pro quo! A few things can help build an army of volunteers: 
- The project must have a vision or story that's [worth contributing towards](https://www.blender.org/foundation/). Even doing something truely cutting edge might be enough to get people rallying around your product: the Apple and Tesla fanbois are a case in point.
- Providing tools that can be used entirely, or partly, free of charge -- and more importantly -- tools that users are free to tinker with and modify. There's nothing that gives hobbyists energy more than the freedom to play with the innards of machines and software.
- Ensure that your project has some decent [starter documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html) that's easy to read and attractive. This will provide the initial intrigue and curiosity. By all means have the more comprehensive documentation available too, if it's there, but some slick graphic design and easy to read typesetting goes a long way.
- Having paid developers, designers and product managers can help provide some structure and stewardship, helping inform the product's roadmap and leads to community energy being channeled towards positive commercial ends. It also shows confidence and commitment from key stakeholders.
- Once your have all of the above then it's just the case of putting some marketing bucks behind the project: social media campaigns, [workshops and seminars](https://2018.pyconuk.org/), competitions etc.
- Once a community for your product/project comes into existence, it's important that it's nurtured. Volunteers want to feel loved and appreciated.

But how do companies afford this sort of investment and how is it profitable? Well, it's increasingly becoming the case that a lack of investment in community building could easily render your product irrelevant and, therefore, the question rather is: can companies afford not to engage in this way?  Users are no longer tolerating vendor lock-in and want to be promiscuous with technology:  your  product will only be used for as long as it continues to add value and if something else comes along that better fits  their requirements, they'll move on. 

The future -- indeed the present -- of digital products is one where users are active participants in something that's continuously evolving, not passive consumers. There appears no better way of ensuring user engagement and long term relevance than enabling a healthy community around your product and -- as mentioned earlier -- when users are free to tinker, modify and share things without being subject to lawsuits, this can lead to a strong sense of trust and love for your product. The community thus becomes a source of all sorts of good stuff, including free marketing, free testing, free ideas and even free data! 

When committed to open sourcing, there are several business models that have succeeded and can be [considered](https://opensource.com/article/17/12/open-source-business-models). Other newer models and innovations will inevitably emerge. Making money from open source is no longer a question, but rather: could an answer.

### Closing comments:
There was a time when the term 'open source' was banded about willy-nilly and with a great deal of hype: some big tech companies were [burned](https://www.networkworld.com/article/2268096/servers/the-downfall-of-sun-microsystems.html) in the process! Open source today is no longer hype, but products developed in this manner continue to footprints throughout the industry. The model is here to stay and largely a matter of necessity and a reason why most large tech companies are involved in open source development in one way or another. Without community participation, it's very easy for a large gap to develop between customer expectations and actual product experience. This makes terrible business sense: if your products are seen as irrelevant, it doesn't matter whether the parent company owns all patents and copyrights -- irrelevant products are dead meat and will take businesses down with them!
