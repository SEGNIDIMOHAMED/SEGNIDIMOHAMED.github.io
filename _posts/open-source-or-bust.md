$34 billion! That is what Big Blue (IBM) has put forward earlier this week, to acquire the world's most prominent open source company, Red Hat. That is a massive vote of confidence. So, as long time open source advocate, I'm going to be really mature about this blow a huge raspberry at all the detractors who have for years dismissed the open source model as a 'fad' that delivers nothing but poor quality, insecure and legally dubious products. You all were so wrong; deal with it!

In fact, I'm going to stick my neck out with a wee prediction: over the next decade, technology companies that don't invest in building collaborative communities around their products, will become a dying breed. This is not about marketing, it's not about tacking on buzzwords whilst otherwise carrying on as usual: it's about survival. Nokia found this out the hard way, when it was effectively wiped out by increasingly tough competition in the form of Google's open source Android operating system. Microsoft  didn't get too far on the mobile front for similar reasons. Nokia of course eventually did open up their Symbian operating system, but only when the game was already over.

Back in 2001, when then Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer described open source with [C-words](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it/) the frustration was somewhat understandable. After having almost besieged Netscape, and looking like the winner in the Web browser wars, Microsoft faced a number of new threats. Firstly, it's dominance in the Web browser arena was called into question, leading to costly legal battles. Secondly, with the release of Netscape Communicator's source code, a threat of open source web browser in the form of Mozilla's, Firefox, could be seen on the horizon. But fast forward to 2016, with a greater focus on cloud computing, Microsoft presented what could be seen as the greatest about turn in technology history, by announcing that it now 'loves' open source. Indeed the company, under the leadership of Satya Nadella, has taken a number of key initiatives that puts some weight to these positive statements. The most recent love bomb comes in the form of the $7.5 billion dollar purchase of Github, the world's largest open source repository.
