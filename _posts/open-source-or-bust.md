$34 billion! That is what Big Blue (IBM) has put forward earlier this week, to acquire the world's most prominent open source company, Red Hat. That is a massive vote of confidence. So, as long time open source advocate, I'm going to be really mature about this blow a huge raspberry at all the detractors who have for years dismissed the open source model as a 'fad' that delivers nothing but poor quality, insecure and legally dubious products. You all were so wrong; deal with it!

In fact, I'm going to stick my neck out with a wee prediction: over the next decade, technology companies that don't invest in building collaborative communities around their products, will become a dying breed. This is not about marketing, it's not about tacking on buzzwords whilst otherwise carrying on as usual: it's about survival. Nokia found this out the hard way, when it was effectively wiped out by increasingly tough competition in the form of Google's open source Android operating system. Microsoft  didn't get too far on the mobile front for similar reasons. Nokia of course eventually did open up their Symbian operating system, but only when the game was already over.

Back in 2001, when then Microsoft CEO Steve Balmer described Linux, the open source UNIX based operating system, with [C-words](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ballmer-i-may-have-called-linux-a-cancer-but-now-i-love-it/) the frustration was somewhat understandable. Having besieged Netscape, and looking like the winner of the 'browser wars,' Microsoft faced a number of new threats. Firstly, its web browser dominance was called into question, leading to costly legal battles. Secondly, with the release of Netscape Communicator's source code, leading to Mozilla's powerful Firefox browser, Microsoft's total dominance on this front was far from guaranteed. But fast forward to 2016 and Microsoft presented,  what could be seen as, the greatest about-turn in technology history, by announcing that it now 'loves' Linux and open source. Indeed, under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft has taken a number of key initiatives that puts weight behind these positive sentiments. The recent $7.5 billion dollar acquisition of Github, the world's largest open source repository, is just the latest in a series of love bombs.

Even Apple has been softening up its stance. Earlier this year the Cupertino giant released the kernel source of its product operating systems (macOS and iOS), on GitHub, of all places!
