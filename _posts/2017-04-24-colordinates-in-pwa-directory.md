My web app, [Colordinates](/blog/colordinates/), an app that displays a colour value based on your geolocation, has been [included in the PWA (Progressive Web App) Directory](https://pwa-directory.appspot.com/pwas/5638503354335232). 

I only added PWA compatibility as a test as part of my [side project learning](/blog/side-project-learning/). The App Cache API is being depreciated in favour of Service Worker. The process I followed via the [Service Worker Cookbook](https://serviceworke.rs/) does not feel as as straight-forward as simple but flawed, App Cache!

Adding PWA support and getting a good Lighthouse (the PWA validator) score obviously paid off, I suspect it was included via the PWA tag on GitHub. I didn’t submit it as I felt the app might seem a little trivial to the projects purpose, but if people can learn from it then I’m good with that. 

Glad there is this directory resource (and [outweb.io](https://outweb.io/) too) and more people are able to learn from or replace their current native apps with web based apps.
