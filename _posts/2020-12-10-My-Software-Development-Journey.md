title: My Software Development Journey

I feel like anyone who's ever gotten into software development has their own unique story. Listening to the 'How I built this' podcast you would think that all programmers were born that way.

But this certainly isn't the case.

Through my journey, I've realised that some discover their passion later than others. Perhaps this a topic that goes beyond programming.

Anyways, here is how I discovered my passion for software dev...

I first learnt about programming and IT in high school. Back then I made a school portal app using Visual Basic which had simple functionality such as logging in and viewing your classes. The app was simple enough but the process was amazing. 

From this point on, I knew what I wanted to do.

After high school, I went on to study Computing and Software Systems at Melbourne Uni. I was so certain I wanted to study this but was discouraged when couldn't keep up. I quikly realised that there is vast difference between high school and tertiary programming.

Due to this, I decided to switch majors altogether. 

However, after completing my first year of university, I knew something was missing. I decided to give programming one more shot before moving I'd truly move on. This time I really took it upon myself to give this unit everything I had.

The hard work paid off and I had finally passed! I was back on track and set to complete this degree with the major I initally wanted. 

Since then, I have taught Python and Javascript to other students, joined Dev(){CoP} meetup and more recently graduate with third class honours.

Although this might not be a super inspirational story to most, it has definetly been an experience for me.

However, this is only the very start of it. I have so much more to learn and am constantly excited by the possibilities.
