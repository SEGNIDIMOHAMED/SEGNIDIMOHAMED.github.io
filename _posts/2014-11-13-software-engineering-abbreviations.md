title: Software engineering abbreviations
---
We use a lot of abbreviations in this field. I've started this post as a way of keeping track of all of them.

AV: Antivirus.
BAT: Build Acceptance Test.
BVT: Build Validation Test.
CBC: Cipher Block Chaining.
CI/CD: Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment.
EICAR: A file that was developed by the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) and Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO), to test the response of computer antivirus (AV) programs. Instead of using real malware, which could do real damage, this test file allows engineers to test AV without having to use a real computer virus.
IV: Initialization Vector. Adds initial randomness to a cipher.
LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol.
PV: Pending Validation.
SAML: Security Assertion Markup Language.
SCM: Software Configuration Management. Refers to Git and other version control systems.
SLA: Service Level Agreement.
SSO: Single Sign On.
SUT: System Under Test.
TAM: Technical Account Manager.
TLS: Transport-Layer Security.
TMI: Thunder Machine Instance.
UAT: User Acceptance Test.
VCS: Version Control System.
