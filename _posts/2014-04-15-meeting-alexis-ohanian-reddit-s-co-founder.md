title: 'Meeting Alexis Ohanian, Reddit''s co-founder'
---
Last semester, I had the incredible opportunity to meet Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit. He visited Oregon State University as part of his "Be Awesome Without Their Permission" tour, and gave an inspiring and humorous presentation about entrepreneurship in the digital age. I'm very much looking forward to reading his book, "[Without Their Permission: How the 21st Century will be Made, not Managed.](http://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed/dp/1455520020)"

He gave one of the most entertaining and inspiring talks I've ever attended, and his Powerpoint slides were hilarious.

After the talk, I purchased a copy of his book and got it signed. He told me he had a friend who looked just like me, so this is what he wrote.
