The following is a list of ["Today I Learned"](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned)-esque facts that I've stumbled across and found interesting.

- Genentech was originally going to be called HerBob, an amalgamation of its founders' names, Herbert W. Boyer and Robert A. Swanson ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/04/07/ibm-and-genentech-introduce-a-new-era.aspx)).
- North Korea has the world's fourth largest standing army, with 950,000-1,190,000 troops conscripted as of 2012 ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_People%27s_Army)).
- Elon Musk owns a website called [x.com](https://www.x.com/). When you visit the home page, it simply displays "x." If you visit any other page, it displays "y."
- OreIda, the American potato-based frozen foods company, is named because it was established on the border between Oregon and Idaho ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore-Ida)). 
- Warren Buffett owns a 2001 Lincoln Town Car with the license plate, "THRIFTY" ([source](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2006/12/05/top-10-vanity-license-plates.aspx)).
- The word "lens" comes from the word "lentil" because of their similarity in shape ([source](https://petapixel.com/2011/10/03/did-you-know-the-word-lens-came-from-the-word-lentil/)).
- [Sturgeon's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) states that "ninety percent of everything is crap."
- [Victor Lustig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lustig) was a con artist who successfully tricked the two biggest scrap metal businesses in France into buying the Eiffel Tower for scrap metal. He's known as "the man who sold the Eiffel Tower twice."
- In the early 1900s, before much was understood about the dangers of radioactivity, America developed an obsession with radium. Its self-luminous properties were used to make everything from paint to glow-in-the-dark watch faces. The [Radium Girls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radium_Girls) were women who worked in watch factories and contracted radiation poisoning from working with it.
- In computing, [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) is a [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym) for "Disk And Execution MONitor."
- From March 1989 - March 1990, Argentina experienced inflation of 20,000 percent. [source](http://www.reed.edu/economics/parker/f10/201/cases/argentina.html)
- [Umberto Eco's anti-library](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/03/24/umberto-eco-antilibrary/) is essentially the idea that, paradoxically, unread books can be more valuable than read ones. It's important to understand the value of a personal library as a research tool, not as a mere ornament of accumulated knowledge. I first encountered this idea in one of my favorite books, Nicholas Nassim Taleb's [Black Swan](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00139XTG4/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).
- [Bluetooth](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2061288/so-thats-why-its-called-bluetooth-and-other-surprising-tech-name-origins.html) is a name that was borrowed from the 10th century Viking king of Denmark, King Harald Bluetooth. He was famous for uniting disparate parts of Scandanavia just as the Bluetooth standard was intended to unite different devices wirelessly. [According to legend](http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2011/10/the-bluetooth-standard-is-named-after-a-10th-century-scandinavian-king/), he got the name "Bluetooth" because he ate so many blueberries that his teeth were stained blue.
- Most time zones differ by UTC by increments of whole hours, but there are some [unusual exceptions](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/time-zones-interesting.html). For example, India Standard Time is at UTC +5:30 and New Zealand is at UTC +12:45.
- Vice President Mike Pence's childhood nickname was ["Bubbles,"](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence) because he was "chubby and funny."
- [Sosumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sosumi) is an alert sound introduced in Apple's 1991 Macintosh System 7 OS. The name is an unsubtle derivative of "so sue me," a jab at record label Apple Corp, which sued Apple for using sound in their products. The sound has been included in all subsequent versions of macOS. Here's a sample of it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlFGmGaq-0M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlFGmGaq-0M).
- The word ["Algorithm"](http://blog.vishupuri.net/2011/01/23/origin-of-the-word-algorithm/) comes from the name Al-Khwārizmī, who was a Persian mathematician, astronomer, geographer, and scholar in Badhdad. One of his books, "Ilm al-jabr wa'l-muḳābala," is where the term ["Algebra"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra) originates. "al-jabr" translates to "the reunion of broken parts."
- According to a study referenced in [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21730430-federal-aid-sent-puerto-rico-fits-longstanding-pattern-counties-voted), given two natural disasters that inflict the same amount of damage, American presidents have been twice as likely to declare a disaster when one occurs in a swing state like Ohio or Florida.
