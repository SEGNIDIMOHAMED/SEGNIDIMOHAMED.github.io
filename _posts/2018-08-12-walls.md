While virtual environments aren't subject to real world forces, for VR users to feel sufficiently immersed some measure of realism needs to be presented. At the very least, even in highly stylised environments, the scaling and sense of 'solidity' should be spot on.

Just how pedantic designers will need be is hard to guage, but getting the balance right will be one of the markers by which we can judge the quality and design of virtual spaces.

Without meaning to stuff traditional architectural theory down the throat of VR space designers, there are some important elements often absent from contemporary VR experiences that really should be given greater credence; I'll discuss some of these below.

### Walls as Architectural elements:

While Architects have been pushing boundaries since time immemorial, their attempts ultimately exist within the realms of physical possibility. Boundaries formed by walls reinforce this fact; indeed, when wall thicknesses are on full display, and thus celebrated, this has further psychological impact.

In VR, any connection formed with the simulated world, any feeling of immersion, immediately breaks down when users are simply able to pop their heads through walls and other objects! Even much loved VR games (e.g. Robo-Recall) are guilty of this.

This cannot be seen as acceptable; at any time when this happens, it makes me cringe and generally cheapens the experience. It's a bit like watching a magic trick after you already know the full details of how it's achieved: it's dull and lifeless!

Standard 3D desktop games don't have this problem: characters can't just walk through walls unless it's intentional and part of the story (e.g. magic potion) or the developers have missed something. This wall collision issue is something unique to VR.

### No more 'wall peek':

Game designers have various solutions to this problem at their disposal, the most common being:-
1. As head goes through a simulated wall, the screen goes black or blurred.
2. Walking through wall results in simulated scene, at the point of impact, moving along with the user.
3. As head impacts a wall, the player is instantaneously 'snapped' back to a point just before the impact; because of how quickly this happens, there's not much scope for nausea. Realising that walls can’t be penetrated, users stop trying and it no longer becomes an issue.
4. A combination of '1' and '3'; where screen goes black, they're pushed back to their last valid location and screen quickly fades back in. All this happens within a couple of seconds.

All of these have their pros and cons, but by far the worst solution is to do nothing. That is just plain lazy! 

With the 1st solution, users often find themselves becoming 'lost' in the 'dark zone' behind walls and other so-called barriers; this  is highly disconcerting. The 2nd solution can mess up room-scale playspace setup and having the entire world moving along with the head seems weird.

On balance, I believe the 3rd and 4th solutions to be the smartest; in fact, from my experience, it's what many of the post 2017 VR games have gravitated towards. The following are a list of games that do employ this method:-

* Serious Sam VR series.
* Talos Principle VR.
* Skyrim VR
* DOOM VFR.
* In Death.
* A-Tech Cybernetic.

Here's an example of this behaviour in Skyrim VR:-

As technology moves on, other solutions will develop, but I can't stress the importance of proper enforced boundaries enough; if you don't have boundaries, you don't have space in an architectural sense and psychologically you'll have one foot in the door and the other foot out, never feeling well immersed and the experience looses it's magic.
