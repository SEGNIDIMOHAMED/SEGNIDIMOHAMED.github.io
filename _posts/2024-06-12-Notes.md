# RANDOM CONCEPTS :




- QUESTION 1 : 
- on microservices, where multiple services of a single application are running independently on containers on different  servers then how would they communicate with one another?

- Answer -
In a microservices architecture, where multiple services of a single application run independently on containers across different servers, communication between these services can be facilitated through several approaches like HTTP -

- HTTP/HTTPS Requests: Services communicate with each other using RESTful APIs over HTTP/HTTPS. Each microservice exposes endpoints, and other services can make HTTP requests to these endpoints to exchange data.

- QUESTION 2. 
- What are Restful APIs?
- Answer - 
- RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer APIs) are a way for applications to communicate over the web. They follow specific rules to make it easy for different systems to understand and interact with each other.

- QUESTION 3.
- what are endpoints in micro-services?
- Answer -
- In the context of microservices, endpoints refer to the individual URLs or network addresses through which clients can interact with specific functionalities or resources provided by each microservice. Each microservice typically exposes one or more endpoints that represent its API surface.
