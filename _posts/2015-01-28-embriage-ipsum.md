While watching the episode of BBC Top Gear where Jeremy and James are driving a vintage French car, I realised the badly translated instructions Jeremy was yelling from the manual would make a good Lorem Ipsum substitute. 

Novelty Ipsum generators were a thing, so I had no trouble finding a JS generator. Then I set to work tracking down a clip of the particular sketch and breaking out the dialogue into an array. Here is the result.

## Typography

My focus then became making the typography reflect the subject material and time period, a great opportunity to use serif fonts.

Didiot and Bodoni are of the time and used for the body copy, I love the variation of stroke thickness. ‘[Chau Philomene One](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Chau+Philomene+One)’ font by Vicente Lamonaca, via Google Fonts is the heading. It‘s reminiscent to me of the historic motor car posters, heavy - almost hand painted - letter forms with a hint of a serif, to contrast the delicateness of the body copy. 

I also got to use `:first-letter` styling to good effect and the repeating radial gradient give an aged paper effect which helped complete the correct look. 

_Embriage Ipsum was chosen for CodePens ‘Picks’ section, which is selected by the sites founders to highlight good or unusual examples of work._
