title: What does quality mean to me?

There are many definitions of Software and Product "Quality". For a long time, earlier in my career, I did much to ignore the topic and felt it was intangible. The definitions that I had at the time were all about only the Correctness, the strict conformance to well specified requirements.

Over the last 3+ years I've massively increased my external communication with the wider testing community. I've read blogs, watched presentations and I've tested a bunch more software.

Now, I'm approaching a point I've got some kind of grasp of software quality, in a way that can be usefully and concisely defined.

## What does quality mean to me? 

### I posted this one Twitter:

> What does quality mean to me? Goodness, Usefulness and Correctness at a point of time, with a context that takes into account ethics, customer success, business success, competitor products and the wider industry. That allows for "good enough" in that context to be enough!

## My definition doesn't exist in isolation

In order to come to this definition, I've spoke to, read and consumed from many great Testers. Notability [Dan Ashby](https://twitter.com/DanAshby04), whom I am now lucky enough to work with, and [Stu C](https://twitter.com/StooCrock).

### Quality Panel

I also took part in a [Quality Panel](https://www.ministryoftesting.com/dojo/series/the-ministry-of-testing-podcast-2021/lessons/mot-podcast-quality-panel) discussion for the MoT Podcast, alongside [Gem Hill](https://twitter.com/Gem_Hill), Alsa Tabatabei and [Lee Marshall]().

### Quality Aspects

In the last few months, I've started making use of [Risk Storming,](https://riskstormingonline.com/) and I love it! The focus the Test Sphere cards can give you on Quality Aspects (aka Quality Characteristics) are really powerful.

### Implicit and Explicit asks

One thing the focus on Quality Aspects, and the definition of quality beyond correctness really brings to light is that checking for Correctness really isn't enough, not even close. And to this end, testing Acceptance Criteria and explicit requirements falls way short.

A really great explanation of this is written up by another fantastic tester, and Exploratory Testing legend, [Callum Akehurst-Ryan](https://callumakehurstryansblog.wordpress.com/about-me/)**,** in the post [WHY CHECKING AN AC ISN’T ENOUGH](https://callumakehurstryansblog.wordpress.com/2021/08/25/why-checking-an-ac-isnt-enough/).

### On accessing and measuring quality

OK, so now I've defined what quality means to me. But, is this useful?

I feel that this short definition hides a huge amount of detail, of course it does, it's only a single Tweet. It also assumes you already have a really clear idea what I mean by Goodness, Usefulness and Correctness, and if you have consumed anything from Dan Ashby in the last year or two, you probably have this context, some links below if you don't.

What I'm missing, still, is a way to strike a balance on how to measure and describe the current quality of a product, and report on that usefully. On one side, there is the huge amount of valuable and highly contextual detail you can gain from detailed testing notes and detailed reports. On the other, the "gut feel" RAG rating, or star rating.

Details are great, for communicating with Engineers and the team, but are hard to "report upwards". RAG statuses, or traffic light style ratings are _course_ and really don't provide enough context to be an honest current reflection of quality. Both ways have risks, and are not appropriate to communicate with everyone.

To be clear, I don't have the answer here, I'm still working on it.
