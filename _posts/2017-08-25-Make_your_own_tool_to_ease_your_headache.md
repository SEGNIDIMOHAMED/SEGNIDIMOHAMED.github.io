title: String builder for BI developer
---

People create tool to make their job easier. Carpenters make wood jig.  Farmers are using spinning wheel for making cloth. 
As a BI developer, I came across many scenario that the job is tedious, but you have to be careful or the code won't work.

I give two examples in SSIS.  The following code are all T SQL code.  

1. I have been using the method describing in the following blog to compared two big tables and do insert and update.  This method works great.  
<http://sqlblog.net/2014/05/01/insert-and-update-records-with-a-ssis-etl-package/>  

The update step is completed by OLE DB command task. This requires you pass in each column value of your incoming record as variables to update your existing record via a stored procedure.

In this case, it only has 5 variables,  what if this is a big fact table that you have 100 columns there. Are you going to manually create 100 variables? 

2. The other example, calling stored procedure in OLE DB source can often confuse SSIS. One way to solve it is to use with result sets clause. There you have to provide the column name and data type.  In my case, query is from a variable. Therefore, it also has SSIS expression, such as double quotation and "\n" for line change.

Manually doing this is painful. Most people know to use INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where it has column and data type. By building string from there, you can quickly get the code you want. But you have to rewrite the code each time to the text pattern needed.  In addition, sometime, you need to get info from a temp table.  Temp table column metadata store at tempdb.sys.columns, while data type is at sys.types with different name, make it harder to track info.

Since I am doing ETL quite often, I am also lazy to remember those system table column name. I would like something either procedure or function, I can passing in the table path and sample string, so that based on the tableâ€™s  metadata, it will automatically yield the string I want.

Here I walk through the procedure I created
