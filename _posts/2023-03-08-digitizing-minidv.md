Back in 2001, I saved up my paper route money for several months
and bought a shiny new [Canon ZR30MC camcorder](https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/dvc675.html). For the next several years,
that camera was glued to my face (only slightly exaggerating) and captured dozens of hours of my life on MiniDV tapes.

Fast-forward 22 years, and I returned home from a trip to visit my family
with that camera and several boxes full of tapes. Thus began my journey into 
digitizing them.

# The hardware

I was surprised to find that MiniDV players are really difficult to come by
these days. I was hoping to find a machine that could play back several of them in parallel,
so I could capture multiple streams at once and speed up the process, but no dice. The ones I did find were on the order of 
$300-$500 and could only play a single tape at a time.

Luckily, the camera's tape deck still worked for playback, so I didn't need to 
solve that problem (for now, anyway. Time will tell if the tape heads hold up for the duration of this project ü§ûüèºÔ∏è).

The camera had a 4-pin Firewire 400 connection for output. I ultimately needed to connect 
that to my 2015 iMac, which takes either USB or Thunderbolt 2 as input. 

In subsequent years, before the whole [Firewall interface was scrapped](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/06/the-rise-and-fall-of-firewire-the-standard-everyone-couldnt-quite-agree-on/#:~:text=The%20decision%2Dmakers%20in%20the,be%20first%20to%20push%20it.), 
Firewire 800 was introduced as the successor to 400. Luckily,
it's backwards-compatible with 400. So I'd need to convert from Firewire 400 to 800 to Thunderbolt 2.

I was able to find all the cables and converters I needed from [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/). 

They arrive next week and I'll update this post with results.
