title: Referencing Chrome Extension resources in CSS
---
For Chrome extension development, if you need to reference an image or other asset for your Chrome extension in CSS thatâ€™s stored in the extension folder, just place this in your CSS selectors:

{% highlight javascript %}
url("chrome-extension://__MSG_@@extension_id__/images/image_name_here.jpeg")
{% endhighlight %}
