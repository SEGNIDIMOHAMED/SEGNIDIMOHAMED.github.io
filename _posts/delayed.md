title: Use Docker to Operationalize the Data Science Prediction 
---

There are many challenges working in machine learning fields. In terms of the time consuming part, one is data preparation, the other one would be operationalizing the model. If you have the right data, building a model actually is a relatively easier part of the whole process.
Let us talk about the operationalization of the model. I have used batch files ([link](https://wenleicao.github.io/Poor_man_automation)) to handle R and python processes and used the task scheduler to schedule a job at a virtual machine in the cloud.  But it is probably not the best way to go because the followings:  

*	It is hard to switch to different visual machine. In other word, the portability is poor.  
*	You are limited in windows machine, whereas majority of servers in the cloud are using Linux based operation system.

Here I want to explore the possibility of using docker to handle data science operations. It is a modern technology and with great potential to solve the issues I list above.  

Docker is a container technology that can package all your artifacts for your application in one folder and move to the host machine (cloud server). Your application will run without worrying about the operating system, hardware and so on. This will fit in with all cloud service 
 vendors like AWS, Azure, GCP, et al. It uses the same concept of container in the shipping industry.  
 
Majority of docker materials and tutorials online are using Nginx or flask, because the end product is a web App. You can easily see the result by browsing the web page.  In my case, I would like to use docker for data science purposes.  Unfortunately, I donâ€™t find a lot of resources online. I think the following sites help me a lot.  

1. Docker tutorial site is good for getting started, but it is not specific for data science.  
<https://docs.docker.com/get-started/>
2. The following site helps me use docker with data science, but the content are a bit dated (not working anymore) and methods are over simplified for real life project.    
<https://mlinproduction.com/docker-for-ml-part-1/>  

I want to achieve the following goals:    
* Being able to build customized docker images for data science purposes.  
* Training and inference processes are getting data from databases (this is common in real life).  
* Try docker compose if there are multiple containers working together (simplify the configuration step).

To run docker in windows environment, you will need the following set up.  
1. Install docker desktop, remember to also check the option to install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2 ). This essentially allows you to have a Linux dev environment in Windows.  
2. Install Ubuntu app from windows store to be able to use Linux shell to interact with docker desktop.  It is a common language in the container world.  
3. In the docker desktop, configure Ubuntu to integrate with docker(WSL Integration). So you can use Ubuntu shell interact with docker.  
4. Install VS code and add extension WSL, so I can use the VS code to view Linux subsystem files and be able to make dockerfile or compose yaml file.
