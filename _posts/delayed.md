title: Use Docker to Operationalize the Data Science Prediction 
---

There are many challenges working in machine learning fields. In terms of the time consuming part, one is data preparation, the other one would be operationalizing the model. If you have the right data, building a model actually is a relatively easier part of the whole process.
Let us talk about the operationalization of the model. I have used batch files ([link](https://wenleicao.github.io/Poor_man_automation) to handle R and python processes and used the task scheduler to schedule a job at a virtual machine in the cloud.  But it is probably not the best way to go because the followings:
