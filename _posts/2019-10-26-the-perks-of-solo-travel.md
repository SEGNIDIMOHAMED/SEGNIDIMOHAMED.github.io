title: The Perks of Solo Travel
---
In September, I went on my first solo international trip for two weeks in Italy. The night before my flight, I found myself lying wide awake in bed, thinking, "What the hell am I doing?" A friend had challenged me to take a solo trip at one point, and I chose to precisely because it scared me. Iâ€™d always thought that you were supposed to travel with other people. I felt self-conscious about the idea of dining alone. I worried about getting lost while navigating the trains in Rome and having no one to turn to for help. I worried about being lonely. But in spite of myself, I got on the plane. And not only did it not suck, but solo travel turned out to be an unexpectedly enjoyable experience. Preferable, even. It expands the horizons of your comfort zone, gives you the freedom to travel on your terms, empowers you to make new friends, and forces you to be in the moment and get the most out of the experience.

## Pushing your comfort zone

Like I mentioned before, I was initially self-conscious about the idea of dining alone. This is not something I would generally do in the States because of that. I'd had this idea that you weren't really supposed to go to restaurants alone. I'd worried that people might think I'm weird or feel bad for me, or that they might ask me why I'm eating alone. I got over this immediately in Italy because, well, I had to eat. And when I did, I realized that people generally aren't paying any attention to you. And if they are, it's because they're friendly and want to talk. Since I've been back in the States, I've found myself going out to eat more solo.

## Traveling on your terms

When you're solo traveling, you get to travel on your terms. Planning becomes much less complicated. You can make the itinerary as busy or relaxed as you want. If you need a rest day, you can take one without impeding anyone else. You can see exactly what you want to see. 

For example, my first day in Rome, I felt like walking 18 miles and seeing all the sights, so I walked 18 miles and saw all the sights. Did I regret it the next day? Yes. But that choice was owned by me! And in Florence, I wanted to see [Galileo's middle finger](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/galileos-middle-finger), which is literally in this glass case in Florence's Museo Galileo.

## Making new friends

In some unexpected ways, solo travel turned out to be more social than traveling with friends. When you're alone, you're much more likely to start a conversation with the person next to you on the train, or at breakfast, or in any number of other scenarios. Minutes after arriving in Rome, I met a fellow American named Andrew who was a teacher. We got dinner with his friends a few hours later, and I ended up hanging out with them almost every night in Rome after work. On the train to Sienna, I met a couple from New York, and we explored the city together. While lost in the Florence train station trying to find my train to the Cinque Terre, I ran into a couple from Deleware who were equally lost and heading to the same place. We talked the entire way up there and then met up for happy hour several times during our stay. 

With websites like AirBnB and Couchsurfing, it's easier than ever to make new friends while traveling. One night I took a cooking class in Frascati where we made pasta from scratch. Afterwards, we all sat around tables together and ate our hard-earned-and-delicious pasta with wine from a local vineyard. After the event, my group took the train back to Rome together and went out for drinks there. I still keep in touch with the friends I made that night.

One of my concerns initially with solo travel was that I would be lonely. This turned out to be completely unfounded. In fact, I would go so far as to say that if you wanted to not make new friends while traveling, you'd have a hard time. And this is a very good thing.
