title: Speaking at BSidesSF 2018
---

I'm grateful that BSidesSF gave me an opportunity to speak and share with the community. It was a lot of fun, particularly getting to see an artist do a live sketch of my talk. After immersing myself in a preparation, it's interesting to see what the main points that a listener is pulling out in real time.

And thanks to BSidesSF for releasing recordings of all of the talks. Here's mine!
