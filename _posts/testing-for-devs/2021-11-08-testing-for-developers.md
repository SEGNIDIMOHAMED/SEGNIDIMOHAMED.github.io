## Developers can't test and other lies

Developers can't test, testers just break code and don't even use tools in their testing! After all Testers are just failed Developers, right?

OK these are maybe some of the more extreme myths about software testing, and I bet you have heard some hum-dinners in your time.

I like to think, we can all benefit from learning more about testing and assessing quality, I know I still have loads more to learn. And while I've cross-posted some of my blogs onto Developer focused communities, now I'm going a step further and creating a series I'm calling **Testing for Developers**.

## The premise

* Bring together people from Tester and Developer communities
* Bust some myths and misconceptions about testing and quality
* Collaborate with Developers to learn and share more about Testing
* Create an accessible resource that anyone can use to learn more about Testing

## How it will work

* I will collaborate with Developers and Testers to map out ideas and produce content
* We will write blogs, record Rackets and maybe record YouTube videos
* Work created as part of the series will link back here
* Where work is created with others, it will primarily or additionally be posted and there accounts, and will be linked to or reproduced here
* Credit will always be given to all contributors for work done together, wherever it's published

## Topics

A short list, and longer mind-map, of initial thoughts for topics. Please feel free to contribute more!

* Myths about Testing
* Skills overlap between Testers and Developers
* Working together to assess quality
* Building successful Dev/Test relationships
* Metrics and how they can help or hinder
