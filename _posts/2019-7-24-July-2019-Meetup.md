## MicroPython C Stub Generator
Oliver gave a demo on his [MicroPython C Stub Generator](https://mpy-c-gen.oliverrobson.tech/). It's a web-based tool that allows you to specify definitions for functions that you'd like to expose from a MicroPython C Module. The tool generates all the important boilerplate that defines the entry points, method registration and parameter conversions required when bridging that C<->MicroPython gap. Super useful if you need to drop in to C but expose a nice interface to MicroPython!
