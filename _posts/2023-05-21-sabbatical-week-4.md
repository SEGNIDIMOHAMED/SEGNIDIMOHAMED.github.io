title: Sabbatical Week 4 - Cat Ba Island, Hanoi, Da Nang, and Seoul
excerpt: A chill last week of sabbatical in Vietnam and South Korea
---

I intentionally left my last week of sabbatical open-ended and didn't 
make any plans beforehand. I was enjoying the beaches and sunsets at Cat Ba Island, so I 
decided to stay there for a couple more days. 

I booked a kayak tour for the morning. I ended up being the only one who booked,
so I got a private tour. The guide was really personable and we talked for several hours.
He had grown up in the area and had been kayaking the bay since he was a kid. I had so many questions 
about what life was like on the floating villages, and we talked about that for awhile. He pointed 
out the karsts that had names, one of which was Turtle Island, aptly named. We got pretty close to some of the 
oyster farms, which made me better appreciate the scale of the operation. They covered a huge area where they were set up.
We stopped a couple times, once to pick up some wild oysters he said he was going to cook for his family, and another 
time at a karst with a small beach to take a quick dip in the water. He said he did both kayak and multi-day hiking tours, which seemed like a pretty strenuous line of work, 
but he said he really enjoyed it.

Back at Quiri, I grabbed a quick shower and checked out of the hotel. I'd decided to switched to 
staying at a hostel called Secret Garden because I liked the artsy aesthetic and 
I wanted to meet some people. The host at Quiri was super friendly and gave me a ride
up the hill to the hostel with my luggage, which was a huge help. It was too close to justify calling a taxi,
but just far enough away to be a pain in the ass to lug my stuff to.

After checking in, I read by the pool for a bit. I talked with a woman named Alina who was sitting next to me.
She was from Holland and had just completed a rotation as a nurse in a neonatal unit in southern Vietnam. She was 
here on a 90-day visa and using up the last 30 days to explore.

In the late afternoon, Andy and I checked out Tung Thu Beach, a less crowded beach that was more 
popular with the locals than the one I'd been going to. On the walk over, we passed some people playing volleyball,
which had apparently become really popular. I didn't remember that from 23 years ago; back then, soccer seemed to have that 
level of popularity here. There were no lockers at this beach, but it wasn't crowded. We piled our stuff on a small tarp Andy
had brought and got in the water. The water ended up being pretty dirty, so we didn't stay too long. Andy's hostel
was just up the road from mine, so we agreed to meet for happy hour after rinsing off.

Happy hour at Secret Garden was really chill. By 5 pm, probably a dozen people were hanging out 
at the tables drinking beer. Waiting for Andy to arrive, I started talking to two women, 
Maddie and Chelsea. They were both in their early 20s and solo-traveling through Vietnam.
They mentioned that they'd connected on the Hostelworld app before arriving. As someone who
usually stayed in hotels, I'd never heard of this chat feature of that app and thought it was brilliant.
Great way to connect with fellow travelers before you arrive somewhere. I was also struck by the fact that
so many women were solo-traveling here. I read later that Vietnam is one of the safest places 
in Southeast Asia, with violent crime being almost non-existent. 

After Andy arrived, we all went to dinner at "Yummy 2" restaurant just down the road. It was 
a favorite of Andy and mine, and lived up to its name. Apparently there's a Yummy 1 just up the road.
I also had read some reviews of people getting food poisoning at Secret Garden, so I wanted to play it safe.

After dinner, we all split up to go to our separate hostels, as everyone else had early mornings.  
I listened to the live music at Secret Garden for a bit, then turned in. I was just winding down,
brushing my teeth, when I noticed a couple massive, hairy legs sticking out from under the sink.
"Oh fuck me," I said out loud. I slowly peeked under to find the biggest, scariest-looking spider I'd 
ever seen. I don't even have a problem with spiders. I usually put them in tupperware and set them free
when I find them in my house. But this thing was a monster. Now wide-awake, I started Googling everything I could.
I quickly assessed that it was a huntsman. Harmless to humans, but with a painful bite.

Still, I wasn't keen on sharing a bathroom with it. I grabbed the hose from the shower and tried to spray the spider,
but the water pressure was pathetic. The spider shook the water off its legs, crawled out from 
under the sink, made its way over to the toilet, and vanished behind it.

Well, fuck. I closed the bathroom door and tried to get some rest. I ended up sleeping really fitfully;
it was hot in the room, I had to pee but didn't dare, and my throat was scratchy. I woke up
at 4 am with a full-blown cold to the sound of a rooster crowing. I gave up on getting back to sleep and read for a bit.

The spider had relocated to the ceiling in a corner opposite the toilet, so I felt safe peeing, at long last.
I still watched it warily the whole time.

At noon, I caught the bus to Hanoi. I checked into the Scent Premium again because I'd liked it 
last time I was there. I spent the next couple days in Hanoi.

Some highlights:
* The Old Quarter shuts down from Friday through Sunday to car traffic. It was really fun to see families out and about there, with kids driving around small electric cars, and live music at night.
* Visiting Train Street. The main part of Train Street is closed to tourists, but if you walk to the far side of it, there are coffee shops you can watch the train from. I ordered some egg coffee and waited for the train to arrive. It was crazy how close it got.
* Seeing a water puppet show. This was suprisingly really cool. It was a great way to take in some traditional Vietnamese stories. Also, have you ever seen a regular puppet show with fireworks? I think not.
* Buying all of the fake North Face and Patagonia bags I could find. I'm really curious which factory/supply chain makes these, because they're uncanny.
* Getting a massage. It was much needed after lugging my stuff around everywhere.

I also visited Hoa Lo Prison, where John McCain was a POW during the war. That was a pretty fascinating experience.
There were a bunch of exhibits of French brutality toward the Vietnamese and stories of 
heroic Vietnamese prison breaks. But when you get to the section on the Vietnam War, it's totally 
whitewashed. They have a bunch of photos of POWs playing chess, smiling, and getting free medical care.
It was pretty surreal. I'm pretty sure John McCain not being able to raise his arm above shoulder level wasn't 
from a chess injury. But the whole thing got me questioning areas where Americans whitewash our museums and leave stuff out.
Where I landed was that we really don't talk much about Japanese Internment or how horrific it was that we used 
atomic weapons on civilians twice.

I thought about visiting Angkor Wat, but the forecast for the next several days showed extreme heat 
and lightning storms, so I decided to save that for another trip.

I flew back to Da Nang for my last few days in Vietnam. I booked a room at the M92 Hotel, which was just a few blocks from the beach.
The first thing I did after I arrived was walk to the beach. I was blown away by how much Da Nang had changed since
we were here in 2000. Back then, the beach was quiet and serene, sprinkled with fishing boats. Now, it felt like Vegas,
with massive hotels and resorts lining the beach and crowds of people everywhere. I felt lucky to have experienced it 
before it had become so commercial. I walked down the beach for a bit, trying to spot anything that looked familiar. 
I Googled our old hotel, the Tourane, but nothing turned up. It seemed to be long gone. At one point, I thought I found 
a place that looked like where it used to be, but it was hard to tell.
