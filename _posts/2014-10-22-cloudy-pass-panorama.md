title: Cloudy Pass Panorama
---
I finally got a chance to stitch together the biggest panorama I took this summer. This was taken during the last sunset I spent at Cloudy Pass. It's difficult to describe the breathtaking beauty and magnitude of this place. These mountains surround you and are all that you can see for miles. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but there is really only one word necessary. Awe.
