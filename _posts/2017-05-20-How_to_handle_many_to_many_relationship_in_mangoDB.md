title: How to handle many to many relationship in MongoDB
---

MongoDB is one type of NoSQL database (Not Only SQL).  MongoDB was generated by 10gen in 2009 to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast and scalable) and relational databases (which have rich functionality). Its name is from "Humongos". It is a document oriented NoSQL database, which is in JSon like format.

The terminology comparison between MongoDB and Relational database

MongoDB can set up relationship between collections (tables) through reference or embed. Let us see how it handle many to many relationship through an example.  

First we set up 3 collection using student course data.

+ course collection   
var coursedata = [  
{_id:"a", coursename:"English", cost: 200 },  
{_id:"b", coursename:"Big Data", cost: 600 },  
{_id:"c", coursename:"Business", cost: 400 },  
{_id:"d", coursename:"Biology", cost: 300 }  
];   
db.course.insert (coursedata);

+ studentcourse collection  
var studentcoursedata =[  
{sid:1, cid : "a"},   
{sid:1, cid : "b"},  
{sid:2, cid : "d"},  
{sid:3, cid : "a"},  
{sid:3, cid : "c"},  
{sid:4, cid : "b"},  
{sid:4, cid : "c"},  
];  
db.studentcourse.insert(studentcoursedata);

+ student collection
var studentdata =[  
{_id:1, studentname:"John" },  
{_id:2, studentname:"Mary" },  
{_id:3, studentname:"Adam" },  
{_id:4, studentname:"Terry" }  
];  
db.student.insert (studentdata);

Now, we have a question such as "who take course of big data?"
