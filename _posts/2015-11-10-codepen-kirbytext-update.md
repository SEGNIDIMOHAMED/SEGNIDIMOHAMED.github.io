The [CodePen Kirbytag extension](/blog/kirbytag-codepen/) allows Kirby CMS powered sites to embed Pen demos easily via the Kirbytext syntax. This is a quick update about some recent improvements.

## Extension improvements

### Now on GitHub

The project has [moved to GitHub](https://github.com/plfstr/kirbytag-codepen), this allowed me to include an appropriate MIT license and keeps my project work in one place and easier to manage.

### No mixed content

The HTTPS version of the CodePen embed JS is now used by default (you can of course amend this back for performance). HTTPS is becoming much more prevalent across the web and this change avoids the issue of mixed content if you make the switch to HTTPS.

I shall continue to make improvements where I can. I hope you continue to use the extension to show off your Pens. Thank you.
