![Forging Iron during the industrial revolution](http://industrialrevolution.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/iron-steel-industrial-revolution.jpg)
Coalbrookdale in Shropshire is often noted as the birthplace of Britain's industrial revolution. More specifially, it was innovations in the iron ore smelting process, developed by Abraham Darby, and the consequent cast iron manufacturing processes that - quite literally -created the building blocks for 18th & 19th century industrialisation in Western Europe. This is the period that witnessed great bridges, imposing factories, domineering steamships and other important endeavours. Heavy industry, as it's now known, is still largely associated with these activities. Steel has replaced Iron as the primary industrial material, allowing for longer spanned bridges, taller buildings and faster transport, but there is still substantial weight attached to the products of this process. And along with 'weight' follows environmental costs in terms of carbon emissions and habitat loss - ultimately this leads to further climate change related wreckage and reduction in 'real' wilderness.

The extraction of resources and the transportation of raw materials inevitably leads to grave environmental damage. This is where product weight is an important consideration. Heavy materials require sufficient energy to extract and transport. Some materials are, of course, more problematic than others. A tonne of aluminium requires vastly more resources to produce than a [tonne of glass](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ad70714a9e0287694999f01/t/5b008674aa4a99a865c783ce/1526761081527/emodiedcarbon1.gif), for example. Buildings and construction projects, in general, are the biggest sinners: from embodied energy point of view, but also in an operational sense. Buildings also have additional externalities in the form of roads, transportation, sewage and other such infrastructure used for servicing them. So, doing away with unnecessary construction would go a long way in reducing carbon emissions. But, more on this later!

![21st century wonder materials are leading to a trend towards lightweight manufacturing](https://www.graphene-info.com/files/graphene/powerbooster-graphene-flexible-touch-panel.jpg)
The 21st century has brought on great advancements in material science. Ever lighter and stronger materials could potentially bring much needed respite in carbon emissions. With the discovery of the 'wonder material,' Graphene, by scientists at the University of Manchester, often seen as a global centre for [lightweight manufacturing](https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/global-lightweight-manufacturing-hub-forming-greater-manchester/), all manner of exciting possibilities await us over the next few decades. Yet, this wave could be consumed by the larger 'dematerialisation' wave that has accelerated as a result of late 20th century advancements in silicone technologies and digital network infrastructure.

Dematerialisation is where stuff, rather than simply getting lighter, actually disappears completely as a result of being rendered irrelevant! For example, it would take a van full of 3.5 inch 1.44mb floppy discs, weighing nearly 400kg, to equal the amount of data that today can be stored on a tiny 32gb pen drive. Another interesting example is that of public telephone booths. The iconic K6 telephone kiosk, designed by Sir Charles Gilbert Scott, stood 8ft tall and weighed around 750kg, but is now mainly used by weekend revellers as a urinal substitute: they've been made irrelevant by the ubiquity of mobile phones. 

![The dematerialising effects of network computing](https://images.pexels.com/photos/159304/network-cable-ethernet-computer-159304.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=350)
The English version of Wikipedia holds the equivelent of [2750 volumes of Encyclopedia Britanica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_in_volumes) and is accessed by around [70 million unique visitors per day](https://tools.wmflabs.org/siteviews/?platform=all-sites&source=unique-devices&range=latest-20&sites=en.wikipedia.org). The stats for YouTube are even more heady: over a billion hours of video content is being viewed on the site daily; that's the equivelent of 500 million T-120 VHS cassette tapes! The Internet is basically one collossal dematerialiser. The trend towards virtualised servers, cloud computing and software as a service (SAAS) further kills the need for 'ownership,' resulting in further efficiency: the popularity of services such as Netflix and Spotify reflects the societal shift towards renting digital products as opposed to owning physical stuff. Efficiency in product delivery means substantial cost savings, but potentially also better environmental outcomes. I say 'potentially' because there are some complications in this scenario.

An 8:30am stroll past any school in a typically middle class suburban neighbourhood will quash any notion that products inevitably get smaller, lighter and more efficient. The site of lots of mums and dads lining up in their Porche Cayennes and other diesel guzzling, 'sport utility vehicles' for dropping off their little darlings at school - it really does put things in perspective. Even the earlier example of YouTube requires some reassessment: video cassettes or DVDs of endless 'crazy cat videos' or other similar memes would not have had many takers back in the 80s and 90s! So, we need to be realistic about any 'weight loss' that can delivered through dematerialisation. The fact is that human nature means that savings in one sphere can open up potential for consumption in other areas, often leading to conspicuous, impulsive or otherwise excessive behaviour. Indeed, the plastics in our ocean perfectly signify the wasteful, inefficient nature of human consumption.

Nevertheless, when seen from a glass half full perspective, the 'cutting off fat' from products can bring about both  environmental and cost savings. Bell Helicopters, for example have [reportedly](https://blog.vive.com/us/2018/09/26/bell-brings-revolutionary-fcx-001-market-10-times-faster-htc-vive/) brought their sleek new FCX-001 helicopter 10 times faster to market by introducing VR technologies in their design flow: that's a huge cost saving, but how? Well, rather than the slow 'heavy' process of getting physical mockups made, they 'built' VR models instead. This allowed super-fast design iterations. VR is the ultimate dematerialiser: entire shopping districts could be [obliterated,](https://nitins.space/virtually-shopping/) university lecture halls could be [flattened](http://thedaily.case.edu/dental-lectures-virtual-reality-flip-learning-experience/), cinema halls no longer needed; the possibilities are vast. Rather than the sterile, patchy greenery we find in many of our towns and cities, the absence of large unnecessary buildings and other 'energy sinks' could lead to opportunities for cultivating natural habitats, parks, lakes and even some real wilderness.

###Closing Comments:
While 'lightweight manufacturing' leads to more efficient, environmentally sustainable products, 'virtual manufacturing' via could potentially reduce weights to zero! This likely leads to significant cost savings. For this to materialise, however, individuals and organisations might need to adopt, what might be termed, 'virtual thinking' - that is, being open to opportunities for eliminating the need for physical stuff (real estate, physical  products etc) by 'virtualising' them wherever possible. The pace of growth seen in VR and related technologies point to a future where this would not only be possible, but also desirable.
