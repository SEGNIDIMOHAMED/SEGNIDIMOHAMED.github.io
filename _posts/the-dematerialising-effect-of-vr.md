![Forging Iron during the industrial revolution](http://industrialrevolution.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/iron-steel-industrial-revolution.jpg)
Coalbrookdale in Shropshire is often noted as the birthplace of Britain's industrial revolution. More specifially, it was innovations in the iron ore smelting process, developed by Abraham Darby, and the consequent cast iron assemblies which quite literally created the building blocks of 18th & 19th century industrialisation in Western Europe: iron bridges, long span factories, steamships, tanks and other important endeavours. Heavy industry, as it's now known, is still largely associated with these activities. Steel has replaced Iron as the primary construction material, which has allowed for longer spanned bridges, taller buildings and faster transport, but there is still substantial weight attached to the products of this process. And along with the 'weight' follows substantial environmental costs in terms of carbon emissions and the consequent climate change related wreckage.

![Extracting resources](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1238864/pexels-photo-1238864.jpeg?dl&fit=crop&crop=entropy&w=1280&h=853)
The extraction of resources and the transportation of raw materials inevitably leads to grave environmental costs. This is where product weight is an important consideration. Heavy materials require greater amount of energy to extract and transport, but of course some materials are more problematic than others. A tonne of aluminium requires vastly more resources to produce than a [tonne of glass](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ad70714a9e0287694999f01/t/5b008674aa4a99a865c783ce/1526761081527/emodiedcarbon1.gif). Buildings and construction projects are the biggest sinners in this regard both from embodied energy and operational energy point of view. Buildings also have additional externalities in the form of roads, transportation, sewage and other such infrastructure used for servicing them. So, doing away with construction projects would go a long way in reducing carbon emissions; but, more on this later!

![21st century wonder materials are leading to a trend towards lightweight manufacturing](https://www.graphene-info.com/files/graphene/powerbooster-graphene-flexible-touch-panel.jpg)
The 21st century has brought on great advancement in material science and ever lighter and stronger materials could potentially bring about a much needed respite in carbon emissions. With the discovery of the 'wonder material,' Graphene, by scientists from the University of Manchester, which is at the heart of this [lightweight manufacturing](https://www.themanufacturer.com/articles/global-lightweight-manufacturing-hub-forming-greater-manchester/) trend, all manner of exciting possibilities await us over the next few decades. Yet, this could be superceded by an even more impactful 'dematerialisation' wave that has accelerated as a result of late 20th century advancements in silicone technologies and digital network infrastructure.

Dematerialisation is where stuff, rather than simply getting lighter, actually disappears completely as a result of being rendered irrelevant! It would take a truck full of 3.5 inch 1.44mb floppy discs, weighing nearly 400kg to equal the amount of data that today can be stored on tiny 32gb pen drive, for example. Another interesting example is that of public telephone booths. The iconic K6 telephone kiosk, designed by Sir Charles Gilbert Scott, stood 8ft tall and weighed around 750kg, but is now mainly used by homeless dwellers for relieving themselves of pent up urine: they've been made irrelevant by the ubiquity of personal phones. 

![The dematerialising effects of network computing](https://images.pexels.com/photos/159304/network-cable-ethernet-computer-159304.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=350)
The English version of Wikipedia holds the equivelent of [2750 volumes of Encyclopedia Britanica](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_in_volumes) and is accessed by just under [70 million unique visitors per day](https://tools.wmflabs.org/siteviews/?platform=all-sites&source=unique-devices&range=latest-20&sites=en.wikipedia.org). The stats for YouTube are even more heady: over a billion hours of video content is being viewed on the site every day; that's the equivelent of 500m T-120 VHS cassette tapes! The Internet is basically one collossal dematerializer. The trend towards virtualised servers, cloud computing and software as a service (SAAS) further decimates the need to own physical products and network infrastructure, resulting in greater efficiency: the popularity of services such as Netflix and Spotify are testament to the success of renting rather than ownership. Efficiency in product delivery is key towards substantial cost savings, but potentially better environmental outcomes. I say 'potentially' because there are some complications in this scenario.

![Plastic pollution of oceans and coasts](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0996/1022/articles/a5b55ef1e443d089fefd6f8433bc90b6.jpg?v=1522955371)
A stroll past any school in typically middle class suburban areas at around 08:45 will quash any notion that products inevitably get smaller, lighter, more efficient and less environmentally damaging. The site of lots of mums and dads lining up in their Porche Cayennes, Nissan Jukes and other diesel guzzling, 'sport utility vehicles,' to drop off their little darlings, really does put things in perspective. Even the earlier example of YouTube also requires some reassessment: very few would have purchased video cassettes or DVDs of endless 'crazy cat videos' or other similar memes! So, we need to be realistic about what environmental savings can delivered through dematerialisation. The fact is that human nature means that savings in one sphere can open up potential for consumption in other areas that is often conspicuous, impulsive or otherwise excessive. Indeed, the plastics in our ocean highlight the wasteful, inefficient nature of human consumption.

![Bell Helicopters used VR mockups in their design process](https://d201n44z4ifond.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2018/09/25135016/FCX-001_Concept_Fly_Over_City_Toronto-1024x647.jpg)
Nevertheless, when seen from a glass half full perspective, the 'cutting off fat' from products can bring about not only environmental savings, but also cost savings. Bell Helicopters, for example have [reportedly](https://blog.vive.com/us/2018/09/26/bell-brings-revolutionary-fcx-001-market-10-times-faster-htc-vive/) brought to market their sleek new FCX-001 helicopter 10 times faster through injecting VR technologies in their design process: that's a huge cost saving, but how? Rather than the slow heavy process of getting physical mockups made, they 'built' VR models for every iteration of their design: they dematerialised the life-sized mockups. This allowed Bell to iterate and perfect their designs much faster than traditional processes. VR is the ultimate dematerialiser: entire shopping districts could be [obliterated,](https://nitins.space/virtually-shopping/) university lecture halls could be [flattened](http://thedaily.case.edu/dental-lectures-virtual-reality-flip-learning-experience/) and cinema halls done away with.
