Inspired by a currently airing pet store TV ad and thought it would be fun to animate as a loader. Because… why not!

First time I have tried to animate SVG in this native way rather than with a framework such as Snap.svg. Uses transform along with keyframes and transform origin to rotate the swing, articulate the head and horizontally translate the chickens shadow.

First time I have matched a font to poultry! Font used is ‘[Lemon](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lemon)’ by Eduardo Tunni.
