I got a chance to play around with a Magic Leap device recently. Here are my quick first impressions.

### Pros: 
- Really light weight and comfortable to wear: game changingly so! The fact is that when I'm in the Hololens, I can't wait to get out and even after 5-10 mins, I've had enough. Not so with the Magic Leap (ML), which just feels so right. 
- The potential for cooler, more exciting apps: whenever I see the Unreal Engine logo appear on a splash screen, I know that I'm in for something punchy; in fact, the hairs on the back of my neck will prick up! And the fact that there is UE4 support for ML is  another game-changing development.
- The operating system is Linux based and the world's most efficient devices tend to run on Linux or some similar Unix variant.
- Donning a ML device makes you look cool, while the Hololens 'helmet' will make anyone wearing it look a bit 'sad.'

### Cons:
- The visual quality doesn't feel ground breaking; the experience is very Hololens-esque, with a restrictive field of view and weak ghosty visuals. It's still a step forwards, but not a huge one.
- I didn't find the hand controller intuitive and they seemed buggy, but this will likely be cleared with future updates.

These are only my initial impressions. I'll reserve full judgement until a more comprehensive trial.

Ultimately, I believe that Magic Leap were probably correct to focus on comfort and style over much improved visual quality. The first step towards engaging users is to ensure that they'll actually want to wear the damn things.  Sony's first Walkman, for example, was lightweight and the headphones sat comfortably on the head: it wasn't an audiophile's dream, but it was convenient and usable; sound quality came later.

Now, to compare the Magic Leap with Sony's Walkman would be too much of an endorsement of a product that has no well established use case; listening to music, on the other hand, is a simple pleasure that was enjoyed long before the invention of the Walkman! There is, however, something to be said for convenience and comfort. 

I'm starting to believe: even the seperation between HMD and belt-pack appears inspired by Sony's product. It just needs the app equivelent of MJ's Thriller, to truely set the wheels in motion.
