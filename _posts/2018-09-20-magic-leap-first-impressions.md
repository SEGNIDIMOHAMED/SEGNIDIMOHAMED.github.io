I finally got a chance to play around with a Magic Leap 'mixed reality' device recently. Here are my quick first impressions.

### Pros: 
- Really light weight and comfortable to wear: game changingly so! The fact is that when I'm in the Hololens, I can't wait to get out and even after 5-10 mins, I've had enough. Not so with the Magic Leap (ML), which just feels so right. 
- The potential for cooler, more exciting apps: whenever I see the Unreal Engine logo appear on a splash screen, I know that I'm in for something punchy; in fact, the hairs on the back of my neck will prick up! And the fact that there is UE4 support for ML is  another game-changing development.
- The operating system is Linux based and the world's most efficient devices tend to run on Linux or some similar Unix variant.
- Donning a ML device makes you look cool, while the Hololens will make anyone wearing it look a bit 'sad.'

### Cons:
- The visual quality doesn't feel ground breaking; the experience is very Hololens-esque, with a restrictive field of view and weak ghosty visuals. It's still a step forwards, but not a huge one.
- I didn't find the hand controller intuitive and it seemed rather buggy, but this will likely be sorted with future updates.
- I'm much more blown away by the capabilities of my Â£250 Windows VR headset than this Magic Leap, which costs 10 times more. This may not seem a fair judgement, but if users aren't blown away by the experience then they're not going to open their wallets: it's too expensive for anything other than industrial or otheriwise corporate, usage.

These are only my initial impressions. I'll reserve full judgement until a more comprehensive trial.

Ultimately, in their focus towards style and comfort, I believe that Magic Leap are probably on to something. The first step towards engaging users is to ensure that they'll actually want to wear the damn things.  Sony's first Walkman, for example, was lightweight and the headphones sat comfortably on the head: it wasn't an audiophile's dream, but it was convenient and usable; sound quality came later.

Now, to compare the Magic Leap with Sony's Walkman would be too much of an endorsement for a product that has no well established use case or clarity of purpose. Listening to music, on the other hand, is a simple pleasure that was enjoyed long before the invention of the Walkman! There is, however, something to be said for usability and comfort.

I'm starting to believe that a couple of further iterations and we could, in the Magic Leap, if have something that's market ready: even the seperation between HMD and belt-pack appears inspired by Sony's product! It just needs bump in visual quality the app equivelent of Michael Jackson's Thriller, to truely set the wheels in motion.
