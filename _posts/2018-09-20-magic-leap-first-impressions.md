I got a chance to play around with a Magic Leap Mixed Reality device today. So, here are my quick first impressions.

###Pros: 
- Really light weight and comfortable to wear: game changingly so! The fact is that when I'm in the Hololens, I can't wait to get out and even after 5-10 mins, I've had enough. Not so with the Magic Leap (ML), which just feels so right. 
- The potential for cooler, more exciting apps: Whenever I see the Unreal Engine logo appear on a splash screen, I know that I'm in for something punchy; in fact, the hairs on the back of my neck will prick up! And the fact that there is Unreal Engine support for ML is  another game-changing development .
- The operating system is Linux based and the world's most efficient devices generally tend to run on some or the other variant Linux.
- Wearing a ML device makes you look cool, while the Hololens 'helmet' makes anyone wearing it look a bit 'sad.'

###Cons:
- The visual quality doesn't feel ground breaking; the experience is very Hololens-esque, with a restrictive field of view and weak ghosty visuals. It's still a strong step forwards, but not a huge one.
- I didn't find the hand controller intuitive and they seemed buggy, but this will likely be cleared with future updates.

Well, these really are my initial impressions. I'll reserve full judgement until more comprehensive trials.

Ultimately, I believe that Magic Leap were correct to focus on comfort and style over much improved visual quality. The first step to engaging with users is to ensure that they'll actually want to wear the damn things.  Sony's first Walkman, for example, was lightweight and the headphones sat pretty comfortably on the head: it wasn't an audiophile's dream, but it was convenient and usable; sound quality came later.
