Built to last. Always delivers. GOAT. 

I want a data system like Tom Brady.

We’ve had problems with relational databases. They aren't Superbowl worthy. So, what data systems are?
Or better yet, what general properties do help a data system achieve GOAT status?

Here is what I have arrived at after a little research: (order and importance tbd)

1) **Robustness/fault tolerance** – the ability to provide the right information in the face of the challenges involved with using, maintaining & growing your service.

2) **Low latency** – the ability to provide the right information when you need it. 

3) **Scalable** – the ability to maintain performance in the face of increasing data or load by adding resources to the system.

4) **Generalised** – the ability to satisfy a range of use cases.

5) **Extensible** – the ability to allow functionality to be added with minimal development cost.

6) **Minimal maintenance** – self-explanatory. Largely depends on implementation complexity i.e. how easy the system is to reason with. 

7) **Debuggability** – the ability to trace the source for each value in the system.

8) **Ad hoc queries** – the ability to arbitrarily mine your dataset. This ability opens the door to discover interesting facets of your datasets.
