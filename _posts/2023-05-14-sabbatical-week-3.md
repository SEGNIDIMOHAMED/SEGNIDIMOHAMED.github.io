# Day 16: Van Long Nature Reserve and Bai Dinh Pagoda

On today's agenda was visiting Van Long, a nature reserve that's home to a massive variety of wildlife, 
including the endangered Delacour's langur, a species of monkey.
The langur is critically endangered, with only about 250 left on the planet. A very lucky few tourists get to see them, so
we were hoping to be among them but expecting not to be.

We knew it was going to be a hot day, so we got an early start. We woke up at 5:30 am and the driver 
picked us up at 6 sharp. This put us at Van Long slightly early. We hung out on the hammocks in front of the 
ticket office until they opened a little after 7. Nicole got tickets and I ordered us some cold coffee from the shop next door.
As we left for the dock, the woman at the coffee shop smiled and said, "Good luck monkeys!" We were hopeful.

The dock was a short walk up the road. Our boat driver was so kind and friendly, and the early morning water was placid 
and peaceful. We saw several species of birds flying by and fishing in the water. As we rounded a corner, about 20 minutes into the ride, 
our driver pointed at the trees in the distance and whispered, "Monkeys!" 
They were far enough away that we had trouble spotting them at first,
but I gradually noticed movement in the trees. As we got closer, I saw the distinctive black and white fur of the langurs.
There were three of them in this spot, playing in the trees. We were completely gobsmacked by how lucky we were to see them.

Shortly thereafter, we saw two more langurs on a cliff. And then another one on a different cliff. 
We couldn't believe our luck! The driver also took us into a couple 
beautiful caves, and we saw a man heading out to fish for the day. It was a wonderful morning. We left a generous tip. 
We were so grateful for the experience and for his eagle eyes in spotting the monkeys, 
and we also hoped he would be able to take the rest of the day off; it was supposed to be another scorcher, and being on the
boat would mean being exposed to the sun all day.

We spent the rest of the morning touring Bai Dinh Pagoda for four hours. It's the largest Buddhist temple complex in Vietnam. 
It was a massive place. At the top of the pagoda, there was a pretty incredible view that gave us a sense of the scale of the complex.
The mercury cracked 102 degrees while we were here, and we were dragging by the end of it. And then we realized we were 
super lost. It took us a few attempts to find the exit, and we had to take several shuttles and walk through two different 
gift shops to finally get there. We spent the rest of the day taking a dip in the hotel pool and soaking in the room's AC. 

Once things cooled off, we grabbed happy hour drinks in town, a short walk from our hotel. On the way, the sun was setting
over the rice fields, which made for a beautiful scene. In town, there were several karaoke buses. We were half tempted to 
stay out late and visit one, but we had another early morning planned to get ahead of the heat.

# Day 17

We spent the day exploring Cuc Phuong National Park, which was about an hour and a half drive from Ninh Binh. A few highlights:

* The Botanical Garden. We saw a massive variety of flora and fauna, including a 1,000 year old tree. There were so many varieties of insect species I'd previously only seen in zoos. Stick insects, wooly caterpillars, massive spiders with claws, giant millipedes. 
* Exploring the Cave of Prehistoric Man. There were human remains and tools here that date back to over 7,000 years ago. 
* The cave was full of bats, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have ventured in as far as we did. But nobody got rabies, so all's well that ends well.
* The Endangered Primate Rescue Center. We saw several species of monkeys and gibbons, including the Delacour's langur, which we'd seen in the wild the day before. Given how much Vietnam's primates have been affected by poaching, it was heartening to see the investment in conservation.
* The Turtle Conservation Center. We saw several species of turtles. The center is working to breed them and release them back into the wild.
* There were butterflies everywhere. [Butterfly season](https://vietnam-online.org/index.php/butterflies-season-in-cuc-phuong-national-park/) lasts from April to mid-May, and it was in full swing. It was magical.

In the early afternoon, we caught a small tour bus to Hanoi, arriving around 5 pm. We checked into our hotel, 
which was in the Old Quarter. We spent some time wandering around the neighborhood. The traffic and crowds were a bit 
of a sensory overload from the relative quiet of Ninh Binh and Phong Nha where we'd spent the past week. We had dinner at a 
small restaurant in the Old Quarter, got a beer at Hanoi's famous Bia Hoi (Beer Street), people-watched for a bit, then 
wandered back to the hotel. On the way back, I impulse-purchased a goofy banana-print outfit I'd seen several people wearing
around Vietnam.
