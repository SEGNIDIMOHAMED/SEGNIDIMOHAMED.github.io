# Day 16: Van Long Nature Reserve and Bai Dinh Pagoda

On today's agenda was visiting Van Long, a nature reserve that's home to a massive variety of wildlife, 
including the endangered Delacour's langur, a species of monkey.
The langur is critically endangered, with only about 250 left on the planet. A very lucky few tourists get to see them, so
we were hoping to be among them but expecting not to be.

We knew it was going to be a hot day, so we got an early start. We woke up at 5:30 am and the driver 
picked us up at 6 sharp. This put us at Van Long slightly early. We hung out on the hammocks in front of the 
ticket office until they opened a little after 7.
