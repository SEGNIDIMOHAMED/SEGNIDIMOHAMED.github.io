title: Object-oriented design principles
---
I recently read [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Freeman/dp/0596007124/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426828085&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+design+patterns), and they had a handy set of Object-Oriented design principles that were repeated throughout the book that I wanted to document for reference.

* Encapsulate what varies.
* Favor composition over inheritance.
* Program to interfaces, not implementations.
* Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.
* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concrete classes.
* "Only talk to your friends."
* "Don't call us, we'll call you."
* A class should only have one reason to change.
