## November 2024 - LLaMA-Mesh and LLMs (again)

"LLaMA-Mesh unifies text and 3D mesh in a unified format by representing the numerical values of vertex coordinates and face definitions of a 3D mesh as plain text. Our model is trained using text and 3D mesh data in an end-to-end manner. Therefore, our model can generate both text and 3D meshes in a unified model". nv-tlabs/LLaMA-Mesh 

More details about Llammesh can be found on its [GitHub page](https://github.com/nv-tlabs/LLaMA-Mesh).


## Different than Meshy

Meshy.ai is a 3D mesh AI model generator that uses advanced AI algorithms to transform text or images into fully textured 3D models. Although it's the most advanced model, it can't generate a plane, but it excels at 'organic' shapes.

Do you prefer making straight cuts or embracing curves when working with wood? In the real world, we often favor flat planes for manufacturing processes.
