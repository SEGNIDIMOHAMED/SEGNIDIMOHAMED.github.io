title: My macOS workflows
---
The following is a list of workflows I use on macOS to boost my productivity. 

_Note: This post is a work-in-progress; will be adding more to it soon._

## Alfred

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is an excellent app switcher, clipboard manager, and all-around Swiss Army Knife for macOS. I recommend picking up the [Powerpack](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/buy/). It's abous $22 as of the time of this writing and opens up tons of functionality.

### Launching URLs

I add URLs to Alfred for dashboards and things at work that I access frequently. That way I can launch them directly in the event that my browser isn't open or is hidden.

### Snippets

Alfred [snippets](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/) are basically stored text clips that you can search and add to your clipboard for pasting. There's also [text expansion](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/snippets/#expansion) functionality that you can make use of. I have snippets set up for things that I type frequently, like the CDN path to this website. Another use case would be for your address or phone number. There are also some useful bundles of snippets that you can download [here](https://www.alfredapp.com/extras/snippets/) and add to Alfred. Here are a few of the ones I use:

* [Mac symbols](https://www.alfredapp.com/media/snippets/Mac%20symbols.alfredsnippets)
* [Ascii Art](https://www.alfredapp.com/media/snippets/Ascii%20Art.alfredsnippets)
* [Emojis](http://joelcalifa.com/blog/alfred-emoji-snippet-pack/)
