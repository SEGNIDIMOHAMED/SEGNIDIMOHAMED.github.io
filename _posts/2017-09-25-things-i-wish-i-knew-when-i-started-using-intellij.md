title: Things I wish I knew when I started using IntelliJ
---
I do all of my development work in IntelliJ on Mac, and this is a collection of tips, tricks, and shortcuts I use to get the most out of it.

# Action Menu

⌘ + ⇧ + A activates the super-versatile [Action Menu](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-to-action.html). Just type in whatever action you're looking for, whether that's commenting your code or popping open a terminal. This menu is extremely useful for when you forget a hotkey (as long as you don't forget the hotkey for the action menu itself).

# Show/hide the items along the edges of the IDE

Click the icon in the bottom left-hand corner of the window to toggle the visibility of the edge items, like projects, Maven, etc. I usually prefer these to be shown.

# Cycle through open files and tool windows

Ctrl + Tab lets you cycle through any processes you have open in the current session.

IntelliJ refers to this as the "Switcher" and it's documented [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/navigating-between-open-files-and-tool-windows.html).

# Navigate to IDE components

IntelliJ has a convention of ⌘ plus a number to pull up various IDE tabs. Here's a list of them:

| Command | IDE component |
|---|---|
| ⌘ + 1 | Open Project Tab |
| ⌘ + 2 | Open Favorites Tab |
| ⌘ + 4 | Open Run Tab |
| ⌘ + 5 | Open Debugger |
| ⌘ + 6 | Open Project ToDos |
| ⌘ + 7 | Open Project Structure Tab |
| ⌘ + 9 | Open Version Control Tab |
| ⌥ + F12 | Open Terminal |

(I'm not sure why ⌘ + 3/8 don't seem to activate anything, at least on my machine as I'm writing this. It may be that I don't have the feature activated that those correspond to.)
