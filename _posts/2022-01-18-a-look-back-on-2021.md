title: A look back on 2021
---
So, yeah, it's been a minute since I updated this site. And by minute, I mean almost a year and a half.

I just completed some backend work on it to fully migrate it to AWS. I had it fronted by CloudFlare previously. They were great, I just wanted to consolidate resources and have a foundation that I could potentially add automation to, for subdomains and side projects. While doing this migration, I realized I hadn't updated the content in awhile. So here we are.

Reading some of my last posts from early in the pandemic, I'm reminded of how those early days felt. Yes, things were scary and uncertain, but in some ways, it also felt like a snow day; There was a novelty to quarantine, working from home was a welcome break from the office, there were memes we all passed around, and we all had some sense that the worst would be over in a few weeks. It was spring and it gave us an excuse to hang out with friends outdoors more, anyway. 

Two years into this, things feel pretty bleak. We had a brief respite last summer when a lot of us got vaccinated, but that was quickly extinguished when the Delta variant hit. As I write this, we're in the worst days of the Omicron wave. My friends who are teachers, nurses, and parents are all burned out. The worst thing is we've lost the light at the end of the tunnel; it's really not clear when we'll be through the pandemic, or even what "normal" will even look like. What's become clear is that it's going to be a long, rough road to endemicity of the virus.

On top of that, there's all the other, intertwined global crises. The global supply chain is a mess. Political polarization in the states is so bad that there are widespread concerns about the sustainability of American democracy. We're experiencing the worst crime wave since the 80s. The climate is getting increasingly extreme; in the Pacific Northwest, we've had some awful fires, an ice storm that left some in Portland without power for 10 days, and a record-smashing heat wave. Geopolitical tensions have heated up between the West and China/Russia. There were trends in play before the pandemic, and COVID has just been an accelerant of them.

I like this quote by Vladimir Lenin:

> There are decades where nothing happens; and there are weeks where decades happen.

We're certainly in the latter times.

That all being said, I'm doing okay. Really. 2021 was a year of ups and downs, but it was good, overall. I'm grateful that the vaccines were created and distributed so quickly. There was never any guarantee they'd be effective, and they've proven to be. I'm grateful to have been able to spend more time with friends and family post-vaccination, after a pretty isolating 2020. I'm lucky; my day-to-day work was largely unchanged aside from transitioning to working from home. I also tend to be pretty regimented, and having a regular sleep/work/exercise schedule has helped keep me sane even when the world gets chaotic. I may not be able to control the world, but I can control whether I go on a run today and make my bed.

If you haven't watched it, I highly recommend this YouTube video by CGP Grey. The ideas presented have been my modus operandi these past two years.

# 2021 Highlights

In March, I got promoted to senior engineer at VEVO. I'm going on my fifth year here and still love it. I'm perpetually grateful for good-natured coworkers and challenging problems to solve.

In May, my sister moved to Portland. It's been excellent living in the same city again. We usually trade off hosting dinner every other week or so.

In August, I moved out of my small studio apartment in the Pearl into a four-bedroom house in the suburbs. It was a big change, and took a few months just to furnish it, but it was most definitely a welcome upgrade. My favorite aspects have been having a dedicated office that I can physically leave at the end of the workday, and having a gym. I've done a few smarthome projects on it already; will write another post about those.

In October, I bought a gravel bike (basically a more rugged road bike) and did a bike trip with my dad in the San Juan Islands. He retired earlier this year, and it's been great to spend more time together.

# By the numbers

I'm a numbers guy, what can I say. 

## Activity

According to my Apple Health data, I:
* Went on 16 hikes totalling 85.8 miles
* Walked 122 miles (probably a low estimate, since I don't always record them)
* Went on 62 runs totalling 276 miles

## Reading

I did a ton of reading this year, totalling 40 books and 11,642 pages. That's an average of about 32 pages per day. The longest book was Douglas Hofstadter's "Gödel, Escher, Bach", at 777 pages, and the shortest was Carlo Rovelli's "Seven Brief Lessons on Physics," at 96 pages. "Gödel, Escher, Bach" was a new year's resolution to read, and it was mind-bendingly good. It completely changed my perspective on what intelligence and consciousness mean, and will most certainly be one that I re-read multiple times over the course of my life.

I also listened to 16,878 minutes of Audible books. Yes, that's 281 hours. I usually have an audiobook going during a run/cooking/doing dishes/driving/getting ready in the morning/etc, so it's easy to crank through a bunch of them.

## Podcasts

I'm also an avid podcast listener. I've been meaning to play around with Spotify's podcasts API, but at the moment, I don't have numbers on these. 

I will say that I've continued to enjoy [Skeptic's Guide to the Universe](https://www.theskepticsguide.org/) (have been listening to them for 10+ years) and [Marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/shows/) for news. A new podcast I got into was [The Michael Shermer Show](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-michael-shermer-show/id1352860989).
