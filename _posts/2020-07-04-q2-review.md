title: Q2 Review

Well, despite a global pandemic that forced us all into lockdown, I managed to maintain my sanity and mostly stay on track with the goals I'd set. Here's how I did.

# Health

## Fitness

I'd initially set a goal to run 25 miles a week, but scrapped that after I got the spin bike. That shifted to just "do some form of exercise 6 days a week."

# Finance

I met 58% of my savings goal. Not great, but there were some necessary pandemic purchases that put a dent in that, like a spin bike, bike carrier for stocking up on groceries, home organization purchases, etc. With those out of the way, it'll be easier to meet this goal next quarter.

# Media

## Books

I read 2,273 pages in 7 books over the course of the quarter.

Here's the breakdown by page count:

And by recommender. 43% of the books I read were recommended by my dad, and 14% by my sister.

## Video games

I played 3 video games this quarter. Animal Crossing was one I chipped away at over the course of April and May, where Last of Us II I got into and beat about a week after I bought it.

I really enjoyed Outer Wilds, which was recommended by a coworker. This game started off as a master's thesis and was such a clever way to tell a story. Essentially, you explore this solar system and piece together what happened to an extinct race of intelligent life that came before you.

# Notes

I used [Tableau](https://tableau.com/) for these visualizations.
