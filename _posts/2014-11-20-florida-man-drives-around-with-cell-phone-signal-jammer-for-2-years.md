title: Florida man drives around with cell phone signal jammer for 2 years
---
This is a pretty funny/interesting story that I heard on the [Security Now podcast](http://twit.tv/show/security-now) earlier today. This wannabe vigilante drove around for 2 years on the highways in Florida with a cell phone signal jammer in his SUV, which is VERY illegal because it blocks emergency services. Cell networks are designed in a way that makes it easy to detect interference (MetroPCS noticed that their signals were regularly flatlining on the same stretch of highway twice a day), but it took awhile to track this guy down. When the police pulled him over to arrest him, they noticed that their radios had lost all contact with dispatch. Heâ€™s not facing any jail time, but IS looking at a $48,000 penalty from the FCC for his antics.
