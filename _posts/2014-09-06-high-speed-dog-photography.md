title: High-speed dog photography
---
During a recent hike to Broken Top, I took a few shots of my parents' dog, Cody, catching snowballs. I used my Canon SL1 on Time-Value mode with a shutter speed of 1/1250, an F-Stop of 7.1, and ISO 100. I was fortunate to have a highly luminescent scene, because a shutter speed that high significantly cuts the amount of light that hits the image sensor. In retrospect, I probably could have increased the ISO to 1600 without introducing too much noise. This would have bought me up to 4 stops of increased shutter speed for more motion-stopping power.

I also took this timelapse of a dog at the top of South Sister. I used Photoshop to stack the images and blend them together, and then I touched it up in Lightroom.
