title: The Information Diet
---
This follows up my original [post](https://www.david-merrick.com/2019/06/15/digital-minimalism-review/) on digital minimalism with a practical guide for how to implement the principles in your own life, and some personal anecdotes on what's worked well for me.

To recap, what is digital minimalism? It's a term first coined by [Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) for a philosophy of taking a more intentional approach to our relationship with technology which prioritizes long-term meaning over short-term satisfaction, and aims for focus in a distracted world.

That being said, our goals with this information diet will be:
- Minimize distractions and mindless interactions with technology
- Maximize time spent in a focused state

And our assumptions are:
- Our self control and willpower is a finite resource so we're not going to rely on it
- Most things are not emergencies

## The phone

You'll get the most leverage reclaiming your attention by starting with your smartphone. It's always the nearest and dearest screen, is filled with apps that are engineered to capitalize on your attention, and checked [every 12 minutes](https://nypost.com/2017/11/08/americans-check-their-phones-80-times-a-day-study/) by most Americans.

### Remove distracting apps

Cal Newport recommends doing a "digital decluttering," during which you purge all distracting apps from your phone, then gradually adding back what's actually useful and being very intentional about this. What worked well for me is deleting Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit from my phone. I kept Facebook Messenger, since most of my usage of that is intentional (as opposed to mindlessly scrolling through my News Feed). With Facebook, I switched to using it entirely from a web browser. I installed the [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) Chrome Plugin, which replaces the News Feed with a single inspirational quote.

My usage of Facebook has become much less distracted and much more intentional since making these changes.

Since I still wanted to use Instagram, and the web app is missing some crucial features like messaging and posting, I established a "vice phone" (trademark pending. Just kidding). This is an old phone where I install apps that are my vices, like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. Every week or so, I'll let myself use it for a bit. If I ever feel like I'm out of control, I throw the phone in a [kSafe](https://www.thekitchensafe.com), which is a time-locked safe. A brilliant invention.

### Keep the phone far away and silenced when you want to be focused

During my workday, I keep my phone zipped up in a pocket in my backpack. It doesn't come with me to lunch, it doesn't come with me to meetings, it doesn't come with me to the bathroom. That change has made my workdays much more productive, and I'm much more present with my coworkers during lunch and meetings.

At night, I plug my phone into a charger across the room, so I don't use it before bed or during the night. I generally do the same thing when I get home. Keeping the phone out of reach unless I need it has made me much less distracted.

Get in the habit of putting your phone into Do Not Disturb mode.

## Batch distracting activities

### Establishing a personal SLA

In software engineering, it's standard to establish a Service Level Agreement around your product. This is a contract that specifies boundaries on responsiveness, uptime, etc. For example, my SLA on this website is that it will be up 99.99% of the time (I have it fronted by CloudFlare and their uptime is 99.99%).

The same approach can be applied to responding to messages. I established a few different priority tiers for these. Tier 0 (higher priority) are Slack messages from coworkers. I thought I could get away with not responding to those for 1 hour. So I either mute or close Slack, do focused work for an hour, and have a quiet reminder that chimes for me to reopen it and check. Most of my coworkers are in the office, so if something is more of an emergency, people can walk over and interrupt me. If you don't have this luxury, you could provide a phone number where people could call you in case of emergency.

Tier 1 (lower priority) are e-mail, Facebook messages, text messages, etc. I decided that it would be acceptable and not piss people off too much if I responded to these 3 times during the day. I set aside 10-15 minutes for this at 9 when I get into the office, just before lunch, and at around 4. In the interim, I intentionally don't check any of these so I can maximize my focus.
