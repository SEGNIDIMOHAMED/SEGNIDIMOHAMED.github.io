title: The Information Diet
---
This follows up my original [post](https://www.david-merrick.com/2019/06/15/digital-minimalism-review/) on digital minimalism with a practical guide for how to implement the principles in your own life, and some personal anecdotes on what's worked well for me.

To recap, what is digital minimalism? It's a term first coined by [Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBRBP7G/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) for a philosophy of taking a more intentional approach to our relationship with technology which prioritizes long-term meaning over short-term satisfaction, and aims for focus in a distracted world.

That being said, our goals with this information diet will be:
- Minimize distractions and mindless interactions with technology
- Maximize time spent in a focused state

## The phone

The place to start is with your smartphone. It's on your person 24/7, filled with apps that are engineered to capitalize on your attention, and checked [every 12 minutes](https://nypost.com/2017/11/08/americans-check-their-phones-80-times-a-day-study/) by most Americans.

### Remove distracting apps

Cal Newport recommends doing a "digital decluttering," during which you purge all distracting apps from your phone, then gradually adding back what's actually useful and being very intentional about this. What worked well for me is deleting Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Reddit from my phone. I kept Facebook Messenger, since most of my usage of that is intentional (as opposed to mindlessly scrolling through my News Feed). With Facebook, I switched to using it entirely from a web browser. I installed the [News Feed Eradicator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en) Chrome Plugin, which replaces the News Feed with a single inspirational quote.

My usage of Facebook has become much less distracted and much more intentional since making these changes.

Since I still wanted to use Instagram, and the web app is missing some crucial features like messaging and posting, I established a "vice phone" (trademark pending. Just kidding). This is an old phone where I install apps that are my vices, like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc. Every week or so, I'll let myself use it for a bit. If I ever feel like I'm out of control, I throw the phone in a [kSafe](https://www.thekitchensafe.com), which is a time-locked safe. A brilliant invention.
