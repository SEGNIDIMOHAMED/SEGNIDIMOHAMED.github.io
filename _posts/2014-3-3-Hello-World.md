- DAY 1 OF LEARNING WITH COREDGE.
- The brief introdution to cloud

# public cloud
- A public cloud is a internet service where services like storage, applications, and servers and other infrastructure delivered over the internet by a third-party service provider. These services are available to anyone who wants to use or purchase them, and they typically operate on a pay-as-you-go basis. these are more scalable platform and all tye infrastructure maintenance, updates, and security will be handled by the cloud provider.


# private cloud
- A private cloud is a computing model where the infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization. It can be hosted on-premises or by a third-party provider, but it is not shared with other organizations. it is more of a personal use. so all the maintenance and changes on the whole infrastructure will be done by that single organization. so they may not be that much scalable as public cloud.

# shell scripting
- A shell is a user interface for accessing an operating system's services.The shell is basically a command line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands, which the shell interprets and executes.
- there are many types of shell we have like bash, zsh and many more. we'll look into bash for now.
- Bash scripting refers to writing scripts using the Bash (Bourne Again SHell) command language. Bash scripts are essentially sequences of commands that are executed by the Bash shell. They are commonly used for automating tasks, managing system operations, and performing repetitive tasks.
