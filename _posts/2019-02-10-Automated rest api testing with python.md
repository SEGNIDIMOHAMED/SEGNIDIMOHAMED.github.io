Last time out I introduced you to the start of my journey to automate all the "test" things in Python. I continue that journey now by switching focus away from frontend, to Restful Web APIs. You can look back at my last post here <https://www.dowen.me.uk/how-I-am-learning-to-test-the-internet-with-seleniumbase/>.

For this leg of the Journey, I will be using the python modules [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/ "Requests: HTTP for Humans") and [pyassert](https://pypi.org/project/pyassert/ "pyassert is an assertion library for the Python programming language.").
