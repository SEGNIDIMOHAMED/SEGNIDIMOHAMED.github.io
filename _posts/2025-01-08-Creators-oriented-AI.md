## December 2024: Anthropic on building agents

"Over the past year, we've worked with dozens of teams building large language model (LLM) agents across industries. Consistently, the most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks or specialized libraries. Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns." (https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)

Anthropic implementation: https://www.anthropic.com/research/swe-bench-sonnet

"It's about building the right system for your needs. Start with simple prompts, optimize them with comprehensive evaluation, and add multi-step agentic systems only when simpler solutions fall short." (https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents)
