title: OSX HotCorners Alternative
---
I'm a frequent user of OSX's HotCorners feature. It allows me to put my display to sleep with a simple swipe of the mouse to the bottom-right corner of the screen. This is handy when I'm stepping away from my computer in order to keep coworkers from status-bombing me in our internal social network. Recently, I thought it would be cool to run a script when I stepped away from my computer, particularly to set my chat status to "away." I realized that this wasn't possible with the vanilla HotCorners, so I looked around for other options. I came across [CornerClick](http://gschueler.github.io/CornerClick/download.html). It's an older project, but still works well. I'm currently running Maverick's on my machine and it's been fine. I definitely recommend this for anyone looking to add more functionality than comes with HotCorners out of the box.
