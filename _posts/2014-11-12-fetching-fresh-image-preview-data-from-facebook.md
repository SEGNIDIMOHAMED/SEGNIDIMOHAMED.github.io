title: Fetching fresh image preview data from Facebook
---
Sometimes I go to share a link on Facebook from my website, and Facebook has an older image in its cache that it uses for the preview. I found out recently that you can force Facebook to update its cache of your link by visiting the Debugger at [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/). Simply go here, paste in your link, and click “Fetch new scrape information.”
