title: Wine Tasting in the Columbia Gorge
---
My girlfriend and a couple friends of ours went wine tasting this weekend. And, naturally, I brought a drone. 
 
There are dozens of vineyards in the Columbia Gorge near Hood River. If you're interested in visiting yourself, here's a map of them: [WINERIES/VINEYARDS  \|  Columbia Gorge Wine Country](http://www.columbiagorgewine.com/wineriesvineyards.html). We were totally overwhelmed with all of the choices, so we pooled our money and hired a tour guide. We went with [Martin's Gorge Tours](http://www.martinsgorgetours.com/), and were really happy with them. Plus, none of us were driving, so we could enjoy all the wine we wanted.
 
This particular flight was over the last vineyard we visited, Garnier.
