Energy is probably in a lot of peoples minds now. It's interesting to see where energy is coming from in the grid. I mentioned <span translate="no">Elitricity</span> in my 2019 year review:

> E-lit-tricity, a quicker overview of the UK electrical grid carbon impact, as the others I found online were slow to load.

Its a simple dashboard which displays the Carbon Intensity API by National Grid. Since Lit updated to 2.0, I have revisited the project and refactored the previous Lit-HTML template approach with Lit components instead. I like how Lit is close to writing native web components, the template is effectively JS template literals.

See the [current grid sources](/elitricity/).

_I have other experiments in an [X-tricity](https://codepen.io/collection/nxmmwb) CodePen collection of forks built with different frameworks: Preact, Preact and Vue, so far._
