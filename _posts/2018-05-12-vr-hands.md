![VR hands in Bullet Train VR ](http://lisapeyton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/oculus-touch-games-1474923390-c5lu-column-width-inline-1479742308-eIRM-column-width-inline.jpg)

Whether computer game characters reflect the ethnic diversity of global gaming communities; is this something that I've thought much about? No, I can't say that I have, but as VR gaming gains traction amongst mainstream audiences, I imagine that these issues will require much more thought and attention.

For most of my early gaming life, game protagonists were largely seen from a third person's perspective: either from the top or side. Controlling the likes of Mario wasn't much different to controlling a robot.

Even when first person shooters like Doom came along, the site of an imposing CRT monitor and a hulking great PC tower was always a clear indicator of the distance between player and character. Moreover, a pixelated white face of an agonised 'Doomguy' reinforced this sense of controlling 'someone else'.

Whether Mario, Doomguy or indeed some blond haired Persian Prince, the skin colour of these characters weren't any more important than that of movie or television characters; it never felt personal.

With the unparalleled levels of immersion now possible in VR, however, these issues are thrust upon us, almost literally, 'in our faces'. When using your simulated hands to bring virtual food towards our mouths, one has to actively resist from instinctively opening our mouths! 

The form, texture and colour that these simulated hands take, therefore, becomes a concern of some importance. Users’ experience in VR can be particularly jarring when the appearance of hands fall within ‘the uncanny valley’: when human-like objects aren't depicted well enough and appear creepy, as a result. Playing host to a body that doesn’t feel like our own can elicit strange feelings and particularly so when there are vast gender and ethnicity differences to bridge.

VR game designers, skilfully, manage to avoid these minefields by either presenting hands in a manner that is stylised, often ghostly, or having them otherwise covered up with gloves or other props (guns etc). In this way, the end user also benefits from not being unduly distracted by their hands and can focus on interactions within simulated environments.
