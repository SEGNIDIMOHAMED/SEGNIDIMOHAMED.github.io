Whether computer game characters reflect the diversity of global gaming communities; is this something that I've thought much about? No, I can't say that I have, but as VR gaming gains traction amongst mainstream audiences, I imagine that these issues will require much more thought.

For most of my early gaming life, game protagonists were largely seen from a third person's perspective: either from the top or side. Controlling the likes of Mario wasn't much different to controlling some robot.

Even when first person shooters like Doom came along, the site of an imposing CRT monitor and a hulking great PC tower was always a clear indicator of the distance between player and character. Moreover, a pixelated white face of an agonised 'Doomguy' reinforced this sense of controlling 'someone else'.

Whether Mario, Doomguy or indeed some blond haired Persian Prince, the skin colour of these characters weren't any more important than that of movie or television characters; it never felt personal.

With the increasing levels of immersion possible in VR, however, these issues are thrust upon us; it's almost literally, 'in our faces'. When using simulated hands to bring virtual food towards our face, one has to actively resist from instinctively opening our mouths! 

The form, texture and colour of these simulated hands, therefore, become a concerns of some importance. Users’ experience in VR can be particularly jarring when the appearance of hands fall within ‘the uncanny valley’: when human-like objects aren't depicted well enough and appear creepy, as a result. Playing host to a body that doesn’t feel like our own can elicit strange feelings and particularly so when there are vast gender and skin differences to bridge.

VR game designers do often manage to avoid these minefields by either presenting hands in a manner that are stylised and intentionally unrealistic or having them otherwise covered up with gloves and/or other props (guns etc). In this way, the end user also benefits from not being unduly distracted by the appearance of their hands and can focus their attention on the simulated environment and associated interactions.

Another approach, used on some rare occasions, is where users can
customise the appearance of their Avatar, by allowing them to change skin tone, clothing, and hair (e.g. Skyrim). And that's cool, but sometimes the simplest approach is to leave the hands looking 'ghost-like', gender and race neutral?

Whatever the case, these are matters that need thinking about and designing carefully; hand interactions are the bread and butter of VR and getting their appearance wrong can leave certain users feeling neglected and unfulfilled.
