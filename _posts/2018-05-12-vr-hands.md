Whether computer game characters are reflective of the diversity found within global gaming communities; is this something that I've thought much about? No, I can't say that I have, but as VR gaming gains traction amongst mainstream audiences, I imagine that these issues will require much more thought.

For most of my early life, game protagonists were largely presented from a third person's perspective: either from above or sides. Controlling the likes of Mario wasn't much different to controlling some robot.

Even when first person shooters like Doom came along, the site of an imposing CRT monitor and a hulking great PC tower was always a clear confirmation of the distance between player and character. Moreover, a pixelated face of an agonised 'Doomguy' reinforced this sense of controlling 'someone else'.

Whether Mario, Doomguy or indeed some blond haired Persian Prince, the skin colour or gender of these characters, wasn't important.

With the increasing levels of immersion that's made possible in modern VR, these issues are, increasingly thrust upon us; VR is literally, 'in our faces'. So much so that, by example, when using simulated hands to bring virtual food to our faces, one has to actively resist from opening our mouths, instinctively; it's insane! The form, texture and colour of these simulated hands become concerns of some importance, therefore.

Users’ experience in VR can be particularly jarring if the appearance of hands fall within ‘the uncanny valley’: when human-like objects aren't depicted well enough and appear creepy, as a result. Playing host to a body that doesn’t feel like our own can be weird and particularly so when there are vast gender and racial differences to bridge.

VR game designers usually manage to avoid these minefields by either presenting hands in a manner that are stylised and intentionally unrealistic or having them otherwise covered up with gloves and/or other props (guns etc). In this way, the end user also benefits from not being unduly distracted by their appearance and can focus their attention on the simulated environment and related interactions.

Another approach, used on some rare occasions, is where users can customise the appearance of their Avatar, by changing skin tone, clothing, and hair. And that's cool, but sometimes the simplest approach might just be to leave the hands looking 'ghost-like' and neutral?

It's not necessary that users play 'themselves' in VR games, but rather might knowingly want to interact as someone else entirely: Batman, for example. Indeed, stepping into someone else's shoes, 'embodying' characters that are so different from oneself, is actually a real hoot in VR! It's fun blasting hoards of aliens as the ridiculous 'Serious Sam' or slashing through future Tokyo as the female ninja assassin in 'Sairento VR'. So long as effort is spent on character building (voice over, cover imagery etc), it can all work well. A compelling backstory might also help seal the deal.

Whatever the case, these matters need thinking about; hand interactions are the bread and butter of VR and getting them wrong can leave users feeling neglected and unfulfilled.
