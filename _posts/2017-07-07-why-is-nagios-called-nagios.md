title: Why is Nagios called Nagios?
---
Stumbled across this tidbit the other day and thought it was funny. According to [History of Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/about/history/), Nagios was originally called "NetSaint." However, due to trademark issues with that name, the author decided to rename it to "Nagios," was a recursive acronym for "Nagios Ainâ€™t Gonna Insist On Sainthood."
