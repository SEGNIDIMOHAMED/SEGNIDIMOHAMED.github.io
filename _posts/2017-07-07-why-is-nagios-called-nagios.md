title: Why is Nagios called Nagios?
---
According to [History of Nagios](https://www.nagios.org/about/history/), it was originally called "NetSaint." However, due to trademark issues with that name, the author decided to rename it to "Nagios," was a recursive acronym for "Nagios Ainâ€™t Gonna Insist On Sainthood."
