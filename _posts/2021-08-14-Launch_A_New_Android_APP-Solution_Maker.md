title: Launch A New Android APP-Solution_Maker
---

About 15 years ago, while I was working at University of Pennsylvania. I started to play with Java to create a few small desktop applications for scientific calculation. For example, solution maker, Real-time PCR calculator.  You can still find those at google code repository.

Google has stopped the support for Google Code repositories partly because technology moves forward rapidly.  Nowadays, nearly everybody has a cell phone. With computing power and memory much higher than first generation PCs, many things can be done with the tiny gadget in your palms.  I have been wondering if I can convert my desktop application to a mobile platform.  Since I am using an android phone, I started with android studio.  

This turned out to be a much bigger challenge than I thought.   
1. Java has evolved from SE 6 to SE 18. While I am mainly working on the backend in my job, I rarely have a chance to brush up my java skills.  
2. Mobile programming has its own way.  Instead of using Swing, you will need to create layout and activities, fragments.   
 
All in all, I took it as a challenge, it took me a few months instead of a few weeks to implement the functionality I want to achieve. But finally, I am getting there.  

Here is the app play store address
