My girlfriend, Nicole, and I visited Costa Rica in December 2022.

It was both of our first times visiting, and had been on my list forever.

It was a blast! I loved the lush jungles, all the wildlife we saw,
the delicious food, and everyone we met was so friendly.

I cut together this video of the trip: {% include video id="YsyMNDR0r1s" provider="youtube" %}

We did our trip in three legs:

* Ojochal area
* Quepos area
* Arenal area

## Driving in Costa Rica

A few quick notes on driving in Costa Rica:

We got our rental car from Adobe. I'd done some research and that seemed to be the car company that everyone
recommended.
As a perk, they dropped it off at our hotel for us. If you're reading this and are planning a Costa Rica trip, be sure
to use the discount code offered
by [this website](https://mytanfeet.com/special-deals/get-real-discount-rent-car-costa-rica/), which
has a partnership with them.

The one thing I'd do differently if I had to do it again was to spring for a 4x4 vehicle. We weren't planning on doing
any
off-roading, but we ended up in a couple situations that required traction anyway. So I highly recommend that. Book well
in advance,
because there weren't any 4x4 vehicles even available when I booked about a month ahead of the trip.

I'd been told before our trip that drivers in Costa Rica tend to be a little reckless and to drive defensively.
We didn't find the first part of that to be the case; Driving there was fine as far as other people goes.
Obviously, driving defensively is good advice wherever you are. What we did find, though, was that the roads tend to
have a lot of potholes, it's often very foggy at night, and there's not always good lighting in the city.
So make sure you have a spare tire (we got a flat repaired quickly at a local gas station), and I'd avoid driving at
night.
