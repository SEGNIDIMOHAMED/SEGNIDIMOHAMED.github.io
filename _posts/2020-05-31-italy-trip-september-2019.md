title: 'Italy Trip, September 2019'
---
I've been quarantined now for 72...years or so and at this rate it'll be another 72 years before I'll get on a plane again, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to write about my trip to Italy last fall.

I'd been wanting to visit Italy forever. My roommate in college had lived near Naples for two years as a kid when his mom was serving in the Army and had regaled me with stories of the late-night Italian culture. As an endurance athlete, I've always been a fan of carb-heavy Italian food. My sister visited the Cinque Terre in 2015 and I was blown away by the photos she took there.

"Have you ever traveled solo? At least once in your life, everyone should," my friend, Lauren, said to me over beers at Kells Irish Pub in Portland one night. My initial reaction was, "absolutely not." I'd always traveled internationally with other people, whether they were coworkers, family, friends, significant others. I was certain that, if left to my own devices, I'd inevitably fuck up, pick the wrong train, and end up super lost surrounded by people who didn't speak my language.

After marinating on it for a month, though, the idea seemed more and more appealing. I liked the idea of having the flexibility to see what I wanted to see, read tons of books, and take a million photos without being concerned with a travel companion getting impatient. 

Ultimately, I accepted Lauren's challenge.

# Trip planning

There's always a tradeoff on a trip between seeing all the things and relaxing. You might maximize exploration, but totally burn yourself out. Conversely, you might maximize relaxing but miss out on new experiences.

I optimized for the middle ground. I decided to set up "base camps" in 3 different locations, which would give me about 5 days at each. This would give me the flexibility to take rest days as needed, take day trips to nearby sights, be able to settle in a little, and enjoy the trip without burning myself out.

My base camps were Rome, Florence, and Riomaggiore, with a final night in Rome before I flew back out.

## Day 1: Tues, September 10

Here we go. After a thankfully restful night of sleep, I spent the first half of the day packing. I made a spreadsheet of everything I needed and checked it off as it went into the suitcase. This turned out to be an effective remedy for my tendency to constantly worry that I'd forgotten something. I caught a Lyft to the airport, breezed through security with my TSA Precheck, and killed the 90 minutes before my 1:18 pm flight watching reruns of Star Trek TNG and eating sushi.

The initial leg to Amsterdam went smoothly. The next one, in Lisbon, had a short layover. I was glad I'd worn running shoes as I booked it to the gate. I arrived in Rome around 2 pm local time. I caught a taxi for the 10-minute drive to my AirBnB, which was in the Flaminio neighborhood next to the east bank of the Tiber River. My hosts were an energetic, charming young couple and the apartment was very chic.
