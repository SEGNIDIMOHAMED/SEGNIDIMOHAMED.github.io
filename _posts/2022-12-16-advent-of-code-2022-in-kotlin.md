title: Advent of Code 2022 in Kotlin
---
It's been a great year to do [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Kotlin. The JetBrains team released a [series of YouTube streams](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFc5cFwUnmwxQlKf8uWp-la8BVSTH47J) for the first 12 days. Every day, a different Kotlin programmer shared their solution. It was a great way to get exposure to standard library features that were either new or that I was less familiar with, and I added several new methods to my [Advent of Code utils library](https://github.com/davidmerrick/advent-of-code-utils).

I'm not a competitive programmer; I would much rather take more time to write readable, factored code. What I appreciate about Advent of Code is that it can be whatever you want it to be. There's room for competition, but there's also room for the fun of solving the puzzles at your own pace. I definitely recommend trying it out, whether you're new to programming or seasoned at it.
