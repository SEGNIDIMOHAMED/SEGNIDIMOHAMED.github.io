Solution to your problem is cntlm

steps to go

First step -->

Steps to get rid of these NTLM proxy Issues permanently.

Second step -->

start cntlm authentication proxy server

make sure your settings.xml file's proxy look like this.

  <proxies>
    <!-- proxy
     | Specification for one proxy, to be used in connecting to the network.
     |-->
    <proxy>
      <active>true</active>
      <protocol>http</protocol>
      <host>127.0.0.1</host>
      <port>3128</port>
      <nonProxyHosts>local.net|some.host.com</nonProxyHosts>
    </proxy>
  </proxies>


NOTE: If you use Cntlm DO NOT leave blank <username></username> and <password></password> in the maven proxy settings. It won't work. Instead remove those lines entirely like in this answer.
