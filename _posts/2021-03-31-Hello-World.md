Welcome to this new blog of mine. It is build with this awesome jekyll integration for Github Pages.

I will mostly write about technical topics like.
* Software Development
* Site Reliability Engineering
* Continues Integration/Deployment
* couple more...

From time to time i will also write about mindset, people and processes in the Software Development industry.

Every blog post just reflects my personal option on the hose topics.

Have fun read it as i had fun writing it.

Let me close with my favorite phrase of all time.
**Everything seams to be impossible until you did it.**
