title: Pandas Cheat Sheet for Database Developer
---
  
Python has been a Swiss knife in the software world. Especially, in the data science field, it offers numerous library, such as numpy, sklearn.  Pandas is one of most fundamental library, which helps user to manipulate data in the fashion like relational database. You often see people import data from csv or other source into data frame.  Essentially data frame is a relation database table. You can do similar thing on it just like you can use SQL to work on table. I compiled most common used command in SQL and the corresponding python code using Pandas, so hopefully, this can server as a quick start for SQL database developer to work on python.   
  
Because Github pages does not support display Jupyter notebook, surprisingly, repository does. So, I load it as Github repository.  You can click the image below to link to that.

### Please Note:
* I listed the SQL command and corresponding python code how to implement the same thing.   
* Some section, I also include hyperlink which I used it as reference. I think it is helpful to read it if you want to know deeper.   

Hope this helps.  

Keep in mind, Python is not limited to this field, it can do many things which the only limits is your imagination. 

thanks
