title: TryHackMe Certification of Completion - Jr. Penetration Tester
---

In my spare time, while waiting for my graduation and sending job applications, I decided to start working more towards my goals and getting at least the TryHackMe courses done.
First one off the count: Jr. Penetration Tester

It was Very interesting and while a lot of the concepts were things I've already learned from CTFs, University or just messing around on my own I think the overall content and hands on approach
of the rooms is something that compliments theory a lot and definitely gets you engaged and more understanding of what you learned.

Looking forward to continue growing in the vast space of Cybersecurity and possibly get more recognized certifications in the future :D
