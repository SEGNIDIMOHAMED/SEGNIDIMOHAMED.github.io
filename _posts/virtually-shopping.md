Mail order and other forms of remote retail marketing have a long history: some estimates stretch as far back the 15th century Venice, when, what's often considered, the first ever ’catalogue’ is said to have been published by a Aldus Puis Manutius.

Shopping in this remote manner, hasn't really changed all that much over the years; it’s essentially still people staring at images of products, reading bits of text and then having stuff either collected or delivered. Indeed, that’s pretty much what the currently estimated 1.7 billion people engage in when they’re shopping on the many e-commerce websites out there.

Despite the convenience of e-commerce, the vast majority of retail sales happen in the traditional bricks and mortar stores. Indeed, even a significant chunk of e-commerce sales still rely on physical stores for the following:-
- Initial reconnaissance activities: product research, getting a feel for the range of products available and comparing these side-by-side.
- Returning goods purchased online that didn't meet the buyer’s expectations (i.e. too big, small, wrong colour etc).
- Shopping as an entertaining, social activity: meeting family and friends, mooching around for curiosities and bargains, soliciting opinions and general chit-chat.

There are numerous reasons why e-commerce has generally failed to unseat these traditional retail activities, but amongst the reasons include:-
- We prefer ‘comparing’ by actually having goods physically near us, so that their scale in relation to each other and our own bodies can be easily ascertained: human beings are 'spatial' creatures (not to be confused with special, which we indeed are).
- We like seeing things displayed in context; this is the reason why furniture showrooms often display their goods in, what are essentially: 'stagesets' with accessories, furnishings, appropriate lighting, fake television screens  etc.
- We hate waiting around for too long: in a world of instant coffee and on demand television, we don't want to waste several days returning or exchanging goods all because we got the sizing wrong!
- Face to face interaction is always going to be more exciting than bland letters on a screen. People don't call their mates over so that they can all shop together on Amazon!

In short: what traditional e-commerce does badly is conveying product scale, proportion and putting stuff in physical context. And what it also lacks is a real-time social experience.

VR and AR technologies have the potential to ameliorate most of these issues, whilst still maintaining much of the convenience that traditional e-commerce offers. Moreover, reducing uncertainties from the shopping process is a win-win for both consumer and vendor. Having people wandering around bricks and mortar stores is costly for retailers to execute: think of all costs associated with real estate, shop assistants and their managers!

It's little wonder, therfore, that the world's largest retailer. Walmart, has recently filed patents that allow for a VR shopping experience.
