title: Sabbatical Week 1 - Vietnam Visa Nightmares and Salvaging the Trip
excerpt: My Vietnam visa was denied at the gate, but I managed to salvage the trip and spend a few days in Japan and Taiwan while waiting for a new one to get processed.

I was so prepared for this trip. In February, I applied for and got my visa, booked my flights,
made a rough itinerary, and booked a few days in a hotel. What could go wrong?

I had an uneventful flight to LAX, grabbed dinner there, then leisurely made my way to the gate.

"Passport and visa, please," the gate agent said. I handed them over. 
She looked for a moment, then a puzzled look came over her face.
She pulled a coworker over, asked him something quietly, he looked, and nodded.

"Your birthday doesn't match your passport," she said. She showed me.

Vietnam, like much of the rest of the world, uses the day-month-year format for dates. 
I recalled vaguely using autofill to fill out many of the fields in the application.

"Oh," I said. "Well, they can just correct that when I get there, right?"

She shook her head. "We need to correct it before you get on."

I found out later that it was strict China Airlines policy to not deliver a passenger to 
a destination where they would be denied entry. The agent told me to sit while they called Vietnam immigration.

I sat for about 20 minutes, and then the agent came back. "It was denied," she said. "We pulled your bags for you."

I felt like I got hit by a ton of bricks. This couldn't be possible. Completely frazzled and frustrated, I walked out into the midnight 
Los Angeles air, not sure even where I was going to stay. I caught a Lyft to the nearest cheap hotel I could find. 
I tried to sleep but my brain was still going full-tilt. I finally managed to get in a few hours of tossing and turning before rising again.

The next day was a blur. I canceled all my flights and was able to recover half the cost. I tried applying for a new visa on my 
phone but the Vietnamese immigration website was broken on my phone, so I hauled my luggage to the Inglewood Library half a mile away.
The security guards were really confused, but I explained my situation and they helped me get a temporary library card so 
I could apply for a new visa on one of the computers. I knew it could take up to a week to get the visa issued, so I came up 
with an alternative plan to fly to Taiwan in the interim, because there were no visa requirements. 

I booked a flight there for the
next morning which had an 18-hour layover in Tokyo. I knew the Vietnam visa turnaround would be slow, so 
I had some time to kill and thought it would be fun to visit Japan again. I got a hotel near the airport so I could get there early. Feeling a small sense of relief that I had salvaged 
some of the wreckage that was now my trip, I grabbed a few beers at the hotel bar and looked at things to do in Taiwan. I crawled into bed
pretty early. As I drifted off, I felt grateful for everyone who had 
helped me today--from the library security guards who got me the library card to the guy at the hotel who upgraded my room for free.
I slept like a rock.

The flight to Japan was about 10 hours. It was during the day, so I didn't get much sleep. I mostly
read and played Advance Wars on my Switch.

I landed in Haneda. Japan's quarantine before customs was pretty impressive. They had this carpet that disinfects your shoes, and a pretty
sophisticated thermal camera system to detect anyone running a fever.

To be continued... :-). Working on this week by week
