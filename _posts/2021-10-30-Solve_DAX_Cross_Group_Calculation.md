title: Solve DAX Cross Group Calculation in Power BI

Accurate dashboard visual relys on the underlying correct data. I like to first get data right in the table, then build visual on top of that.  

In the matrix power BI report, you will see multiple layers of hierarchy columns and your measures are sliced and diced by the columns.  Most times, we come across single parent hierarchy, like the left diagram. But occasionally you will see multi parent hierarchy (right diagram)
