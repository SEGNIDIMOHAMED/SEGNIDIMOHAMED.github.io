title: Holden highlights from Summer 2014
---
This summer was a very unique time to be in Holden Village. Rio Tintoâ€™s $200+ million mine remediation project was running full-throttle and extensive infrastructure projects were undertaken in the absence of guests. The following is a list of some of the major happenings of the summer.

## 1\. We ran the entire village on diesel.

The mining company was digging an 80-foot-deep [barrier wall](http://www.holdenvillage.org/mine-remediation/2014-rio-tinto-community/) to prevent mine runoff from the tailings from seeping into Railroad Creek. Because of this, they had to temporarily shut down the hydroelectric plant that usually powers the village. A pair of massive diesel generators were used in the interim.
