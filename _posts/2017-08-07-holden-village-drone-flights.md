title: Holden Village Drone Flights
---
Here are some videos from a few drone flights from my recent trip to [Holden Village](http://www.holdenvillage.org/), WA. These were shot with my [DJI Spark](https://store.dji.com/product/spark?gclid=Cj0KCQjwq7XMBRCDARIsAKVI5QZzhq3XNqAj3J4QCYkSOi-RAW1ypa-bhTpFarJQFxHTA6VF0MnCJFYaAjx7EALw_wcB), an excellent drone for backpacking.

## Cloudy Pass

This is Cloudy Pass. In my totally-not-biased-or-limited opinion, it's one of the most beautiful places on the planet. It's a pristine alpine meadow about 10 miles away from Holden, situated between several snow-capped peaks, Spider Glacier, and the Lyman Lakes. Oh, and a bunch of cute marmots live there.

## Hart Lake

Hart Lake is about 4.5 miles from Holden. During the summer I worked at the village, I did a trail run here every other day and the view never got old. It was spectacular to see it from the air.

## Holden Lake

This lake is a steep, 4-mile hike from the village that is well-worth the effort.

## Lady of the Lake II

No roads lead to Holden, so the only ways to get there are by boat or by backpacking in (or, you know, helicopter or something). This is the Lady of the Lake II, the most popular way to get there. My family and I always catch it here, at Fields Point. It then takes us 50 miles uplake to Lucerne landing, where we catch one of Holden's fleet of schoolbuses to take us the remaining 11 miles to the village.

## Image Lake

Image Lake is a beautiful, pristine alpine lake about 17 miles from Holden. It gets its name because it reflects an image of the distant Glacier Peak when viewed at a certain angle. My girlfriend and I did a 3-day backpacking trip out here, camping at Cloudy Pass both nights.
