title: Image Lake Hike
---
**Distance:** 36 miles (round trip).

**Difficulty:** Moderate. The trails are well-maintained for the most part, but there is quite a bit of elevation change. The distance would be challenging to someone not in shape for it, especially with the additional weight of a backpack and camping gear.

**Elevation profile:**

Note: This doesn’t accurately reflect distance; I drew out a GPS track hastily and mapped the elevation profile that way. So this is straight-line distance across many areas, including the switchbacks. The distance to Image Lake from Holden is 18 miles, not 13. There is about 3,300 feet of elevation change, but it’s more gradual than this graph indicates.

**Summary:**

I went with a group on August 1 and we split the hike into 3 days, camping at Cloudy Pass on both nights. On day 1, we hiked from Holden Village to Cloudy Pass (10 miles). On day 2, we hiked from Cloudy Pass to Image Lake and back (16 miles). On day 3, we hiked back to the village.

**Day 1: Holden Village to Cloudy Pass (10 miles)**

We left by 6 am, aiming to beat the heat and be at Cloudy to set up camp by 1 pm. The 4.5-mile trek from Holden to Hart Lake is mostly in the forest, but near the lake there is a hill that provides an excellent view of Railroad Creek Valley. Smoke from forest fires combined with morning mist created this image as we looked back.
