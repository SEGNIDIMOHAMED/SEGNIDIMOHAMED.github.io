A motley crew of 10 friends and I spent last weekend backpacking Indian Heaven Wilderness, in southern WA.

It's one of my favorite places to backpack, because it's relatively flat and there are lakes almost every half mile to camp at. We started at the Thomas Lake trailhead, hiked to Bear Lake, set up camp, and then hiked back. It was about 16 miles total.

Blue Lake (appropriately named), about midway.

The water was great (I heard).

We brought along a couple canine companions, and they had a blast.

On Saturday night, we lucked out with a totally clear sky, perfect for shooting photos of the Milky Way over the lake.
