title: Why I'll still use 1Password over Apple's new password manager
excerpt: Apple Passwords is great, but lacking several key features that 1Password has
---

Apple [recently announced](https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-passwords/) that they're adding a standalone password manager app for iCloud Keychain passwords. 
This is a great move, and I'm glad to see them finally making passwords a first-class citizen. It's available in the App Store now
and will be included in iOS 18 by default.

That being said, I'll still continue to be a loyal 1Password customer for the foreseeable future. Here's why.

# It's not just for passwords

I keep a lot more than just passwords in 1Password. Including:
* Credit card numbers
* My passport and drivers license
* API keys
* Security codes for my building

1Password also is incredibly flexible with setting up any number of custom fields for each item.

# Location-aware passwords

1Password has a beta feature where you can set up location-aware passwords. For example, I added location to my passwords 
for my apartment so I can quickly pull up security codes for the building, or my door code at my friend's place when I'm dogsitting for him.

# Terminal integration

1Password has a CLI tool that I use all the time for work. I can reference passwords in my scripts and use them as environment variables.

# Sharing

Apple's Passwords app can only share via AirDrop at the moment, which severely limits it. 
1Password has an awesome sharing workflow that generates a random url that you can send to someone. You can configure this 
url to only be viewable once or for a certain amount of time.

# Multiple websites

Apple's Passwords app can only configure a single website per password. 1Password can handle multiple websites. Which is great when you have,
say, the same login for Disney and Hulu after the merger.
