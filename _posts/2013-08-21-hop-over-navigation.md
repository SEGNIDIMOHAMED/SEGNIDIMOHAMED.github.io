My latest Pen ‘[Hop Over Notification Badge](https://codepen.io/plfstr/pen/cgsGH)’, over on CodePen is a subtle z-index based CSS animation, creating a notification-type badge hop over effect.

Inspired by a tutorial on WebTuts, ‘[Menu Notification Badges Using HTML5 Data-Attributes](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/menu-notification-badges-using-html5-data-attributes--webdesign-6273)’, the effect utilises CSS @keyframe animation, transition, transform and HTML5 data-* attributes to create a hop over animation to highlight badges, counters or user alerts.
