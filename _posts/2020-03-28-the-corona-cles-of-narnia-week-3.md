This was my third week of quarantine here in Portland. I felt a little lethargic by Friday, but overall it was productive.

What's kept me sane is being religious about adhering to a schedule. It's easy to let work bleed into personal time and get burned out before you realize it.

# Projects 

I installed a wall-mount for my bike for convenience, since I'm riding it more often. It also saves me from making too many trips to the basement bike room in the elevator.

I decked out my Roomba in R2-D2 decals.

I started writing this darkly funny [Slack bot](https://github.com/davidmerrick/quarantinebot) to remind me how many days I've been in quarantine. Other coworkers have come up with more manual ways of tracking.

# News recap

Things moved fast this week. On Monday, we got the official Oregon "stay at home" order, which caught precisely no one by surprise. Rumors were floating around about it late last week. We went from 179 known cases to 479. We're still super limited in our testing capacity, so the number is likely much higher. This was the week I started wearing a mask in my building and while shopping. I'm still amazed by how few people I see in masks. 

Nationally, the virus continued to cut through the population like a scythe. The U.S. became the top country by cases, and the current estimate is that we're at least a month away from the peak. New York got hit especially hard. In Portland tech, Vacasa announced [layoffs](https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2020/03/20/vacasa-announces-large-scale-layoffs-slashes.html) because demand for vacation homes has fallen off a cliff.

Amazon announced that many "non-essential" items would be delayed in shipping until the end of April, but I definitely ordered some non-essential things and had them arrive in 2 days. I imagine the dark days of Amazon shipping delays are still ahead of us.

And everyone started watching this [tiger show](https://www.netflix.com/title/81115994) on Netflix.

In happier news, Animal Crossing came out and I picked up a copy. It's just as addictive as it was promised to be. Naturally, I named my island "Corona."
