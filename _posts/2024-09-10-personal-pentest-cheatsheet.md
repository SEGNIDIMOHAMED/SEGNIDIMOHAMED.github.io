title: \[WIP\] My personal Pentesting Cheatsheet
---

Some time ago I've started my journey on Hack The Box (HTB) to complete the Penetration Tester learning path that they offer.  
While doing so, I have also started to take notes on GitBook and created my own personal penetration testing cheetsheet!

I'd like to share it even if it is currently still in development as this blog is usually linked to my professional profiles so that, for those few who seem to be visiting it, they can easily find more about my commitment and enjoyment of the topics of Cybersecurity.

At the time of writing I have completed 21.06% of the path

but according to the profile "Student Transcript" I am already at the top 5%

I'll try my best to continue this course in hopes to one day get the CPTS (HTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) certificate.
