I'm freezing this blog and starting to post on [my Substack](https://newsletter.languagemodels.co/) instead. The authoring experience is much more convenient for me there. Please follow me there, and check out [The Illustrated DeepSeek R-1](https://newsletter.languagemodels.co/p/the-illustrated-deepseek-r1) if you haven't yet.

And check out our [How Transformer LLMs Work](https://bit.ly/4aRnn7Z) course!
