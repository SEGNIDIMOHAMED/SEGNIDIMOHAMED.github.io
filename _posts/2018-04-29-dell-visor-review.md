Motivated by a desire to explore VR content from home, I set out on this quest with the following requirements in mind:-

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Budget:** < £350.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**Space:** modest sized bedroom.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**Content:** Easy access to some cool games.

The budget and space requirements automatically ruled out the HTC Vive, even if I went down the 2nd hand route. So, it became a showdown between Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) based headsets.

### What did I go for?  
The Dell Visor 'won' me over in the end, and here's why:-  
- It looks so cool: I seriously dig that minimalist, bug-eyed aesthetic.
-  With 'Inside-out tracking', it keeps the setup extremely fuss free. There's just a single lead that splits off into two: one end for the HDMI port and the other for USB3.
- At 2880x1440, it sports one of the highest resolution screens currently available in the UK.
- It feels robust and well made.
- The price was right: £240 on eBay , brand new, sealed and with hand controllers.
- I like trying cutting edge tech; stuff that's not quite ready for prime time, that's a little rough and still a work-in-progress, gets me excited.
- Portability: I can just stick it in my rucksack and take it to my friends' places for a VR party!
- Access to top quality VR content via Steam within months of release.

### So, am I pleased with the purchase?  
With over one month's worth of usage, I've had a lot of fun with it and recommend it to anyone with space and budget constraints.
The inside-out tracking works well, and while users might momentarily lose tracking, if hands are kept far away from the two front cameras for too long, bringing your hands back into view usually sets things right again within a second or so. Once games are 'optimised' for inside-out tracking in the way that many Oculus Rift or PSVR games are optimised for front-facing scenarios, the experience would be even smoother.
