Motivated by a desire to explore VR content from home, I set out on this quest with the following requirements in mind:-

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Budget:** < £350.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**Space:** modest sized bedroom.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;**Content:** Easy access to some cool games.

The budget and space requirements automatically ruled out the HTC Vive. So, it became a showdown between Oculus Rift and Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) based headsets.

### What did I go for?  
The Dell Visor 'won' me over, and here's why:-  
- It looks so cool: I seriously dig that minimalist, bug-eyed aesthetic.
-  With 'Inside-out tracking', it keeps the setup extremely fuss free. There's just a single lead that splits off into two: one end for the HDMI port and the other for USB3.
- At 2880x1440, it sports one of the highest resolution screens currently available for any mainstream VR headset in the UK; only beaten by the Vive Pro.
- It feels robust and well made.
- The price was right: £240 on eBay, brand new, sealed with hand controllers included.
- I like trying cutting edge tech; stuff that's not quite ready for prime time, is a little rough and still a work-in-progress, gets me excited.
- Portability: I can just stick it in my rucksack and take it to my friends' for a VR party!
- Access to top quality VR content via Steam within months of release.

### So, am I pleased with the purchase?  
With over three month's worth of usage, I've had a lot of fun with it and recommend it as an entry into VR and a decent stop-gap solution while waiting for the next generation of headsets.

There are some niggles though; how minor or major these are perceived to be, will vary between individuals. The inside-out tracking of hand controllers, for example, while generally working well, might momentarily glitch if hands are kept outside of the front cameras' field of view for too long, bringing your hands back into view soon sets things right. Moreover, the severity of tracking loss differed between applications; in some applications it's hardly ever noticeable, but in others it's more of a nuisance. There's, however, no problem whatsoever with hmd tracking and once games are 'optimised' for this inside-out tracking in the way that many Oculus Rift or PSVR games are optimised for front-facing scenarios, the experience should be even smoother.

But overall: I'm as pleased as punch!
