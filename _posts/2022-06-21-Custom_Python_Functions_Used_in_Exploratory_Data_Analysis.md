title: Custom Python Functions Used in Exploratory Data Analysis
---

A thousand miles begins with a single step. Similarly, any fancy machine learning begins with  exploratory data analysis (EDA). Because of that, you would think there will be a lot of resources for this. Surprisingly, it is not. Let us google the best book for EDA.  Here are two top links for EDA from google search.

The first link gave us a few more kaggle links with some experts in the field sharing their notebooks, which did enlighten me quite a bit. In the second link, a few people mentioned a book authored by John Tukey, named “Exploratory Data Analysis”. This book was first published in 1977. I don’t question the theory of the book. But it will not teach you too much about using python to do EDA.   

After reading a few Kaggle articles and data science blogs, I think the following links are very helpful. They provide different perspectives that how others do this part.  You might want to read it over.
