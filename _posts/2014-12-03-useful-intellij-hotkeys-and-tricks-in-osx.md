Tab to autocomplete: One annoyance with IntelliJ is that autocompletion doesn't account for a token already being present before it inserts. So you end up having to delete text if you're already in the middle of a method name and do autocomplete, for example. A way around this is to hit the Tab key instead of the return key when doing autocomplete. This will then autocomplete in the way that you'd expect.
