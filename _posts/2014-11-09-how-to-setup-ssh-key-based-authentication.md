title: How to setup SSH key-based authentication
---
Want to log in to your Linux server without using your password AND be more secure? You can do this with SSH keys.

SSH Keys consist of a public and private keypair, generated with a cryptographic algorithm. These keys serve as a means of authenticating to a server using public key cryptography and challenge response authentication. Using SSH keys has two advantages over password authentication. First, convenienceâ€“you can authenticate using the key and no longer need to use a password. Second, (assuming you've disabled password authentication on your server) you protect yourself from brute-force password attacks.

Let's get started.

On your client, generate a public and private keypair using the terminal.

{% highlight shell %}
ssh-keygen -t rsa
{% endhighlight %}

Stick with the defaults by just hitting Enter through the interactive prompts.

Next, add your public key to the ~/.ssh/athorized_keys file on your server.

{% highlight shell %}
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@remoteserver "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
{% endhighlight %}

Now you should be able to login to your server without your password.

{% highlight shell %}
ssh user@remoteserver
{% endhighlight %}

If you run into trouble, make sure that the permissions are set correctly on your ssh folders on client and server. The ~/.ssh folder should have permissions 700. Your private key should have permissions 600. Your public key and known hosts file should have permissions 644. And authorized_keys should have permissions 664.
