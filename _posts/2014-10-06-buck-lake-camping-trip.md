title: Buck Lake camping trip
---
I spent the weekend camping at [Buck Lake](http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/mthood/null/recarea/?recid=52892&actid=50). It's a serene alpine lake in the middle of the Mt. Hood National Forest and the camping spots are an easy, mile-long hike from the parking lot. The fall colors were gorgeous.
