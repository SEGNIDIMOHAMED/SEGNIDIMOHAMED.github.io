# Ola's Music Directory

An abridged listing of music I am either involved in making, or listen to a lot.

## Dandelion Gold

Dandelion Gold is the recording and music production studio where me and my husband Johnny Goss have created and recorded a lot of music over the years.  The links below are just a small slice.  There is a lot more you can [here](https://www.dandeliongold.com/work).

Some highlights from me and Johnny:

### Cock & Swan

Cock & Swan is the main music project that me and Johnny have worked on together since 2006.

#### Studio Performances & Other Music Videos

* [Cock & Swan - Rabbit's Dream (Live Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_33Wg-8Kt0)

#### Music Videos I've Edited

One of my favorite things to do is edit existing footage to our music:

* [Cock & Swan x TZECHAR - Taken Apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsJXyzoiReM) 
* [Cock & Swan - What Was Life? (EP Version)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2gJtfhH_aI)

* [Cock & Swan - Looking Out (Brian Binning Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvxs80ePzwk)

### Johnny's Composition Work

Johnny also composes music for video games and other artistic projects such as contemporary dance.  His [2022 Composition Reel](https://youtu.be/_x7fZeSbu1E) gives you a taste of a variety of projects.  I need to make him a new version soon.  I am always impressed by how versatile Johnny can be when creating music, and it still sounds exactly like something he would do.
