                  Elixir work, mostly backend, with progressively more LiveView. Learning a bit of the SRE related topics as I go.

                      Working mainly in Phoenix LiveView, doing all that needs to be
                      done. Turns out I'm a code quality/software engineering nerd

                  <p>
                      Started out as a software engineer, grown to be a tech lead. As a
                      tech lead I was responsible for project from it's concept to
                      deploy to prod. I've been in a few teams before that, writing both
                      core and marketing related code.

                      Not a regular thing, most notably written frontend in Elm for
                      recycling machine and helped one cool company with Elixir.

                  <p>Finished for now, but maybe will do some in the future.</p>

                      I was helping to maintain, develop and improve internal legacy
                      system and make users happy.

                      I got there just in time to make an impact on creating new system.
                      Afterwards I worked on complete rewrite of a legacy system, which
                      was successfully delivered

                      I was working in a number of projects, greenfield, ongoing and
                      legacy, mostly integration projects. This is where my journey
                      began.
