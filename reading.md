I'll add more book reviews here later. I mostly read nonfiction, and particularly enjoy biographies and science writing. 
A few of my favorite authors are Walter Isaacson, Siddhartha Mukherjee, Atul Gawande, 
Tracy Kidder, Malcolm Gladwell, Mary Roach, David Quammen, Matt Ridley, David Johnson, and Sam Kean.


I keep my [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33961466-david-merrick) up-to-date, 
so feel free to follow that as the source of truth on what I'm reading.
