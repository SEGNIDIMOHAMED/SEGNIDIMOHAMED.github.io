There's a lot of generosity in tech ocmmunity to non-profits, and sometimes it's a little difficult to put all the items together. Even if you have a $5000 of free compute resources from a cloud provider, that doesn't actually translate into a website or backups or anything with actual mission value to a non-profit without some technical expertise. 

So here's my offer. If you're a 501(c)3 non-profit in the United States and need a little help getting things off the ground reach out to me and I'll help tie together a basic package of completely free tech resources together. You can give me the documentation, I'll get you a basic website and email together to get you off the ground.

## Caveats and Warnings
### You will need a magic typewriter letter
First off the magic peice of paper that makes this all go round is an IRS determination letter. You have one, you can get free stuff. If you don't, you can't get free stuff. 

The IRS determination letter usually comes after you file a huge pain in the butt called the IRS form 1023, and looks like something still typed by hand from a 1960's typewriter, but it's a magic piece of paper. Essentially, while lots of technical organizations have no problem giving away another free seat on a platform which has a marginal cost of basically nothing to them, they care a whole lot if they have to start spending resources determining what charitiable orgs are legitimate and worthwhile to support. And with the IRS form 1023 such a pain to fill out, it's a pretty decent shorthand for them to evaluate. If you're willing to spend the time and able to convince the IRS that you should be a non-profit, then it's a pretty safe bet that you're not secretly a fly-by-night squirrel timeshare con.

But you may say; The IRS said “Churches that meet the requirements of IRC section 501(c)(3) are automatically considered tax exempt and are not required to apply for and obtain recognition of tax-exempt status from the IRS.”

Great, you're totally right. That doesn't mean that these tech companies have to give you anything. They want to see the letter.

But you may say; my political direct action group is doing way more good for the world than any of those other sham 501(c)3s!

Great, you're probably right. That doesn't mean that these tech companies have to give you anything. They want to see the letter.

But you say, that's such a stupid hassle for a brand new non-profit getting off the ground!

Great, you're right. And that might mean that the best thing for your organization to do is get a free @gmail.com account and start serving people with imperfect tech. Many great non-profits started out without a website, email, or video conferencing. Particularly if you're just starting to explore the need that you're thinking needs to be met, you should explore that space before and get crisp on your mission before you worry about getting an official website.
