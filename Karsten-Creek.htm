				<H1>Karsten Creek - Andrew Green Renovation</H1>
				<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karsten_Creek' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Karsten Creek</a> in Stillwater, Oklahoma opened in 1994.  The <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.stwnewspress.com/sports/osu_sports/how-holder-made-his-dream-a-reality/article_b758d016-ebc7-5296-b8c2-07be11e6389a.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>$1 million gift</a> from John Solheim of PING golf was the source of the Karsten namesake for the golf course.  Budget to construct the 1994 course was between $3 and $4 million.  Designed by Tom Fazio, the course garnered critical acclaim and has hosted prestigious university national championships.</p>
				<p>Exciting changes are forthcoming as Oklahoma State University announced a $120 million donation from the T. Boone Pickens Foundation with approximately $31 million to be allocated for extensive renovations to the Karsten Creek golf course.  Past golf coach and athletic director <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Holder' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mike Holder</a> is credited for the initiative to build the course for the Oklahoma State University golf team.</p>
				<p>Cart paths and the irrigation system will be reconstructed.  Golf architect Andrew Green started renovation in October 2023.  Discussion of green complex changes and potential re-routing with changes to hole corridors are on the table for the 18 month golf course construction/renovation period.  Back tees were 7,400 yards prior to the Andrew Green changes - expectations for additional length to challenge college golfers is expected.</p>
				<p>Additionally, a state of the art heating and cooling system, possibly <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://driptips.toro.com/subsurface-drip-irrigation-sdi/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>sub-surface drip irrigation SDI hydronics</a> will be installed beneath the greens, ensuring optimal temperatures year-round.  The hydronic system transforms labor requirements by reducing hand watering the greens during the summer and reduces water requirements.  Also, the system reduces the necessity for fans for air circulation.  By effectively managing the turfgrass, challenges from summer heat are minimized where the grass cannot photosynthesize properly becoming stressed to recover from ball marks or withstand foot traffic.</p>
				<p>a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.kyleacallahan.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Kyle Callahan</a> is the grow in superintendent for the next chapter of Karsten Creek.  Oklahomas's climate support both C3 and C4 grass types.  Cool season C3 grasses like ryegrass and tall fescue will combine with warm season bermuda C4 grass types.  Bentgrass greens will part of the grow in.</p>
				<p>Andrew Green has degrees from Virginia Tech in <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.vt.edu/academics/majors/landscape-design-and-turfgrass-science.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Landscape Architecture and Turfgrass Science</a>.  In recent years, Green has found championship golf re-design acclaim at Congressional Country Club's Blue Course, site of the 2022 Women's PGA Championship, and Oak Hill Country Club, site of the 2023 PGA Championship.</p>
