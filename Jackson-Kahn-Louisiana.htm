        <p>Tim Jackson and David Kahn have extensive experience in golf course design, having worked on both new golf coourses and renovation projects around the world.  The team believes that a well-designed course should be fair to all skill levels, and that it should incorporate the natural beauty of its surroundings.
          Jackson Kahn Design is a member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects.  <a href='https://www.conwayfarmsgolfclub.org/project-conway-2023-taking-off-706c3006.html?LayoutID=74' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Recent renovation projects include Convway Farms</a> where the design team led Wadsworth construction in updating the Tom Fazio design.</p>
