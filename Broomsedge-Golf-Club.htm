        <p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.instagram.com/broomsedge_club' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Broomsedge Golf Club</a> will be a private club in the South Carolina Sandhills opening in autumn 2024.  The golf course is designed by Kyle Franz/Mike Koprowski with golf construction suppport from Nick Mazella of <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://x.com/MazzellaGolf/status/1725475784981205112?s=20' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Mazella Partnership</a>.</p>
        <p>Routing has been completed.  The property is 2,500 acres and was once a working farm.  The land is characterized by its classic land movement in the sandhills and pine forests.  Final shaping began in 2023.</p>
        <p>Geologically, the Carolina sandhills are characterized by quartz sand soil that has its origins from sea deposits over millions of years.  As the sea receded to the current Atlantic shoreline, it left behind the landscape of sandy ridges and dunes ideal for golf.  The area is also known for its rolling hills in contrast to the flatter coastal, piedmont regions of the Carolinas.  As seen in Pinehurst, the sandy soil topography of the region creates a unique ecological niche and is known for its longleaf pine forests which have adapted to the relatively dry conditions.</p>
