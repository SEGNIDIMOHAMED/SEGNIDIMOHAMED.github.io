I served as a panelist for an INFORMS chapter talk on trends in Analytics, AI, and Data Science in the Social Impact space. The panel focused on current observations in mission-driven work and how it is being influenced by data. Other topics included ways to get involved, necessary skills, and what to look for when seeking mission-driven data-related work.
