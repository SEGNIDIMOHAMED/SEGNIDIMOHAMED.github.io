Organized and presented a paper at the AIIDE 2016 Games Analytics Workshop. Paper was titled _The Sensitivity of Retention to In-Game Advertisements: An Exploratory Analysis_ and was co-written with [Zachary Burns](https://www.usfca.edu/management/faculty/zachary-burns) and [Isaac Roseboom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-roseboom/?originalSubdomain=uk). Paper can be found [here](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AIIDE/AIIDE16/paper/view/14064/13623).

The paper itself looks at how advertising within mobile games effects user behavior, specifically retention. We found limited evidence that advertising changes how much users play, though our study is limited in a number of fundamental ways.
