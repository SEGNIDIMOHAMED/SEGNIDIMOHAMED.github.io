For The University of San Francisco's weekly seminar series I repeated a talk that I have given a few times about common failure points when running A/B tests. 

Since the students in this seminar had not yet taken their Design of experiments course, I focused the majority of this talk on the basics of A/B testing and just ran through the common issues I normally talk about in a short amount of time.
