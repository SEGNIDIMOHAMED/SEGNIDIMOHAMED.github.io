In this talk I briefly covered a number of common issues arising when doing A/B tests in practical environments. The focus of the test was on issues that academics tend to gloss through (such as user-level identification). This talk was an invited talk at the Canadian Statistical society annual meeting which was held in beautiful University of Manitoba.
