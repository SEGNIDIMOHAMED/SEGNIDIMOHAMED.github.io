Once again, in conjunction with San Francisco Beer Week, we hosted an event with talks from USF faculty on the long history between Beer and Data. I gave a short talk about the [Gosset, Guinness and the t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset) as an introduction. A student group demonstrated an R-shiny app that they designed to build the ``optimal" SF pub crawl, [Justin Catalan, CEO of Fort Point Beer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justincatalana/) spoke about how he built the software powering their logistics operations and we ended the event with our modified [lady tasting tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea) experiment, but this time ascertaining if people can tell the difference between draft and canned beer.


The event was held at USF's downtown campus and around 125 people attended, despite it being on Valentine's Day!
