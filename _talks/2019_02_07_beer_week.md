For the third year, in conjunction with San Francisco Beer Week, we hosted an event with talks from USF faculty on the long history between Beer and Data. I gave a short talk about the [Gosset, Guinness and the t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset) as an introduction. The event was hosted by Original Pattern Brewery (our first east bay) and the turn out was surprisingly high, considering it was a Tuesday night!

A student group presented their work on the ABC news project, while two professors gave short talks about some of their work! We ended it with our modified [lady tasting tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea) test with, once again, draft vs. canned.
