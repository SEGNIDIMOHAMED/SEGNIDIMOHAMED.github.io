As part of the [Foundations of Digital Games conference](http://fdg2021.org/) I was the keynote speaker of the [Games Analytics Workshop track](https://sites.google.com/view/gaw21/). 

The talk that I gave ([slides here](/assets/Games_Analytics_Workshop.pdf)) was similar in intention to a number of the talks that I've given about A/B Testing. This talk focused on some issues that I have seen arise when building A/B testing systems, but with a focus on convincing academics to get involved.
