During this talk I spoke through some techniques that analytics teams can use to to help build games _before_ they are launched. Traditionally BI and analytics play only a small role at the design stage and the purpose of this talk was to highlight some useful and significant ways that data science can help at this important stage in game development. 

Before the talk I did an interview which was used as part of the event's press. The full article can be found [here](/assets/GABI_Interview.pdf), a screenshot of the first page below!
