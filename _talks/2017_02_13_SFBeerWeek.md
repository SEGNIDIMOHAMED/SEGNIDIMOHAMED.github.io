In conjunction with San Francisco Beer Week, I  hosted an event with talks from USF faculty on the long history between Beer and Data. I gave a short talk about the [Gosset, Guinness and the t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset) as an introduction. [James Wilson](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/james-wilson) spoke about using networks to understand beer reviews, [Zachary Burns](https://www.usfca.edu/management/faculty/zachary-burns) spoke on the psychology of inebriation and [Nathaniel Stevens](https://uwaterloo.ca/scholar/nstevens/) ran a modified [lady tasting tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea) experiment, but this time ascertaining if people can tell the difference between draft and canned beer.


The event was at a [Standard Deviant Brewery](https://standarddeviantbrewing.square.site/) and had strong attendance from faculty, staff and students of USF.
