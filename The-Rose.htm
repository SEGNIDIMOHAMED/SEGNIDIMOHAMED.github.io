				<p>The property promises to be a significant development in golf architecture and landscape design. Spanning 588 acres in Hull, Georgia.  With a 15 minute from Athens and the University of Georgia, the property has already received anticipation from the local men's and women's golf teams at the university.  The 18-hole invitation member club is planned to open in 2026.</p>

			<p>The trend of new golf course construction shifting to the Southeast has been notable with new projects in Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee over the past decade.</p>
			<p>Local community involvement outlined for The Rose is an annual golf tournament for Madison County Chamber of Commerce.  Ken Morgan is the high school golf coach for The Madison County High School golf team.  Plans are to have a match with practice rounds in advance to help the team learn and prepare for the match.  The site is also being planned to have the capability of hosting a future NCAA National Championship with The University of Georgia as the host.</p>
			<p>The Madison County planning video outlines the details of golf course approvals. From a civil engineer there is a licensed survey required.  Consultants to the project include golf Architects working with landscape architects.  Zoning changes and tax revenue from future residential property taxes are considerations for the county and local residents.  Paving the neighborhood for interior roads and a Homewoners Association(HOA) are part of the planning.  Geotechnical Engineers and environmental consultants are included early in the project before the country submission.  Planning for sourcing water from wells and runoff into low lying areas is part of the landscape and design efforts.</p>
