			<p>Tripp Davis is an up and coming golf course architect with a national background in amateur golf.  Davis has made significant contributions in Georgia with his work on Augusta Country Club and Atlanta Athletic Club.  Both of clubs are steeped in history and tradition.  Davis' leadership in their renovation and restoration projects have been recognized as instrumental in preserving their legacy while enhancing their playability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
			<p>Augusta Country Club founded in 1899 is a Donald Ross design and adjacent to the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia.  Davis was entrusted with modernization and preservation of the historic design.  Davis enhanced strategic aspects of the course while preserving the traditional Ross character.</p>
			<p>Davis' work at the Atlanta Athletic Club focused on the Highlands Course, which had previously been redesigned by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and then by his son Rees Jones.  Davis' renovation was aimed at refining the course including strategic bunkering, reshaping of greens, and modern turf management practices to advance playing conditions year-round.</p>
			<p>The trend of new golf course construction shifting to the Southeast has been notable with new projects in Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee over the past decade.</p>
			<p>Local community involvement outlined for The Rose is an annual golf tournament for Madison County Chamber of Commerce.  Ken Morgan is the high school golf coach for The Madison County High School golf team.  Plans are to have a match with practice rounds in advance to help the team learn and prepare for the match.  The site is also being planned to have the capability of hosting a future NCAA National Championship with The University of Georgia as the host.</p>
			<p>The Madison County planning video outlines the details of golf course approvals. From a civil engineer there is a licensed survey required.  Consultants to the project include golf Architects working with landscape architects.  Zoning changes and tax revenue from future residential property taxes are considerations for the county and local residents.  Geotechnical Engineers and environmental consultants are included early in the project before the country submission.  Planning for sourcing water from wells and runoff into low lying areas is part of the landscape and design efforts.</p>
