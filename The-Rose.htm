				<p>The property promises to be a significant development in golf architecture and landscape design. Spanning 588 acres in Hull, Georgia.  With a 15 minute from Athens and the University of Georgia, the property has already received anticipation from the local men's and women's golf teams at the university.  The 18-hole invitation member club is planned to open in 2026.</p>

				<p>Tripp Davis is an up and coming golf course architect with a national background in amateur golf.  Davis has made significant contributions in Georgia with his work on Augusta Country Club and Atlanta Athletic Club.  Both of clubs are steeped in history and tradition.  Davis' leadership in their renovation and restoration projects have been recognized as instrumental in preserving their legacy while enhancing their playability and aesthetic appeal.</p>
				<p>Augusta Country Club founded in 1899 is a Donald Ross design and adjacent to the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia.  Davis was entrusted with modernization and preservation of the historic design.  Davis enhanced strategic aspects of the course while preserving the traditional Ross character.</p>
				<p>Davis' work at the Atlanta Athletic Club focused on the Highlands Course, which had previously been redesigned by Robert Trent Jones Sr. and then by his son Rees Jones.  Davis' renovation was aimed at refining the course including strategic bunkering, reshaping of greens, and modern turf management practices to advance playing conditions year-round.</p>
				<p>The trend of new golf course construction shifting to the Southeast has been notable with new projects in Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee over the past decade.</p>
