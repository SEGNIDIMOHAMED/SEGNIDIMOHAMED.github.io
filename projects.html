          <h4>Building now</h4>
          <p>
            I'm building <a href="https://www.tonetastic.studio/">ToneTastic</a>, a fun way of learning Sound Design.
          </p>
          <h4>Fulltime jobs</h4>
          <p>
            I worked mainly with backend (thou I thouched early React and Angular 4 at some point), 5 years with C#, 4 years and counting with Elixir. Along the way I wrote integration systems, backends for web interfaces,
            rewrote a legacy project or two (that's surprisingly fun!). Now I'm also running my own team, building a project I'm responsible of.
          </p>
          <h4>Freelance</h4>
          <p>
            I did a frontend for a recycling kiosk. You can put waste there and get points to exchange for points to use across the city. I did it using Elm 0.13 and it's still running in production without hiccups. CSS was a
            big pain thou.

          <h4>e-ink badge games</h4>
          <p>
            Created a small quiz and simple "pick your own adventure" game for an e-ink badge. It was used for event that promotes science and technology among kids in 2022
          </p>
          <h4>Talk with a robot (twice)</h4>
          <p>
            With <a href="https://doomhammer.info/">my good friend</a> we brought Nao robot to life, wiring it to LLM. Once, as a generic personality for Night of Scientists, second time for Jan Heweliusz birthday. Kids really liked it.

          <h4>Drumming</h4>
          <p>
            I currently play drums with a local band: Lucha Beaver. We're working on EP which I'm slowly mixing.
          </p>
          <p>
            I composed and recorded drums for
            <a href="https://album.link/pl/i/1570284078"> a prog rock album</a>.
          </p>
          <h4>Music production</h4>
          <p>
            There is some stuff at
            <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dreat_nihil">on my soundcloud page</a>
            - a bit of dark ambient + some music challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            In May 2022 I performed debut MonoChromancer ambient concert in front of 600 people at
            <a href="https://festiwalswiatla.hs3.pl">Festival of Light</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            In May 2023 I performed as MonoChromancer again at FoL in Gdańsk. This time I also
            <a href="https://album.link/s/2YVFDSW2w99MUYaijNaytQ">released a debut album</a>
          </p>
          <h4>SonicPi workshops</h4>
          <p>
            I did a SonicPi workshops for IKM Gdańsk and Starter. This was aimed for total beginners to start making music with code.
          </p>
          <h4>Music for Metabow (wip)</h4>
          <p>
            I'm making music for
            <a href="https://aerloth.itch.io/metabow">Metabow, a VR Game</a>. There's already a build with some music by me, there's a need for some battle music as well.
          </p>
          <h4>Gamejam music</h4>
          <p>
            I made a music for a
            <a href="https://satolas.itch.io/spacelinks">Spacelinks</a>, game made for GMTK Gamejam 2021. I had 48hrs to work on this. While our idea for final piece was much more ambitious (and music was made), folks who made
            the game didn't have time to properly implement complex layering system. What's in the game is cool as well, it's just the idea that sparked during last 8 hours of work. I'm really glad how it went. Definitely will
            work with guys in the future, it was a blast.

          <h4>Music for astrophotography themed YouTube channel</h4>
