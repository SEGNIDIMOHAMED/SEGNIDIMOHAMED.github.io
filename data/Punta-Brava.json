La Bufadora is the 2nd largest marine geyser in the world.  The best time to see the blowhole is during high tide, when the waves are strongest. The blowhole is also more active during the winter months.</p><p>Another nearby attraction are the vineyards and wineries in Valle de Guadalupe.  This region is home to over 100 wineries providing ample opportunity to sample at wine tastings.</p>"
