The settlement requires the developers to reduce the size of the project and to take steps to mitigate its environmental impact.</p><p>The Guenoc Valley Project was originally proposed in 2016. The project would have included a golf course, a spa, a hotel, and hundreds of homes. However, the project faced opposition from environmental groups and local residents who were concerned about its environmental impact.</p> <p>In 2020, the California Attorney General's Office filed a lawsuit against the developers of the Guenoc Valley Project, alleging that the project violated state environmental laws. The lawsuit was settled in 2023.</p><p>Under the terms of the settlement, the developers of the Guenoc Valley Project have agreed to reduce the size of the project by 50%. The project will now include a golf course, a spa, and a hotel, but no homes. The developers have also agreed to take steps to mitigate the project's environmental impact, including planting trees and shrubs to help protect the watershed.</p>"
