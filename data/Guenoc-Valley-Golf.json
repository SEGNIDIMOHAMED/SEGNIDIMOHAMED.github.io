The routing by Tom Doak, a renowned golf course architect, would be located on 1,000 acres of land in a remote, rural area in the northern part of Lake County.</p>The project would be a valuable addition to the area's recreational offerings.  To revive the project, the developer could work with local residents to address their concerns, most importantly to develop a plan to address water conservation measures.</p>"
