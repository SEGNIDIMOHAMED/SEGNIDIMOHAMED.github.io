The course opened in the second half of 2023.  The property covers 135 acres of land featuring 18 holes of championship golf with 7000+ yards from the back tees.</p><p>Owner Brad Ralston invested in sustainable measures for water collection in the 6 acre lake onsite.  Challenge is built into the design.  For example, the 11th hole is a 501 yard par four.  For water capacity usage, additional wells off-site are available for future potential growth.<p>Fairways are Innovation Zoysia grass.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2020/05/05/texas-am-agrilife-research-breeds-viable-zoysia-grass-for-putting-greens' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Innovation Zoysia</a> was developed at Texas A&M.
