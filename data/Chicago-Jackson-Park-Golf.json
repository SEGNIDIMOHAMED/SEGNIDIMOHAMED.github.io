					"text": "<p>The most recent update on the Tiger Woods golf renovation project in Chicago is that it is still in the planning stages to merge the Jackson Park and South Shore golf courses. The city has not yet secured the necessary funding for the project, and it is unclear whether the project will be able to overcome the environmental concerns that have been raised.  Tiger Woods' project to renovate two historic golf courses on Chicago's South Side has been met with mixed reactions. The project, which would merge the Jackson Park and South Shore golf courses into a single 18-hole championship course designed by Woods, has been praised by some for its potential to revitalize the South Side and provide a much-needed boost to the local economy. However, others have criticized the project for its high cost and any potential impact on the environment.</p><p>In January 2023, the Chicago Park District announced that it had hired a consultant to help with the planning of the project. The consultant is expected to complete a feasibility study by the end of the year.  Mike Keiser has given his support for the renovated golf course in the past.  The project is estimated to cost $30 million, and it is unclear how the city will raise the necessary funds. Some have suggested that the city could use money from the Obama Presidential Center, which is currently under construction in Jackson Park. However, others have argued that the city should not use money from the Presidential Center for a golf course, as the Presidential Center is a much more important project. The project has also been criticized by environmental groups, who argue that it will require the removal of hundreds of trees. The city has said that it will plant new trees to replace the ones that are removed, but environmental groups are concerned that the project will still have a negative impact on the environment. Despite the criticism, the renovated golf course has received support from many community members. Some have argued that the project will provide a much-needed boost to the South Side economy and may give people on the South Side a chance to play golf on a world-class course.</p>"
