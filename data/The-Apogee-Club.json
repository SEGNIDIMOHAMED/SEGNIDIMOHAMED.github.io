The club will have 2 driving ranges, including a 360 degreee range and practice facility.  TifTuf Bermuda grass, developed by the University of Georgia through a rigorous testing and development process, is used in the fairways. TifTuf is known for its superior qualities in turf quality and water requirements.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.rainbird.com/golf/products/integrated-control-system/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Rainbird Irrigation Control(IC) System</a> has been chosen onsite.  TifEagle was developed by the University of Georgia in Tifton, Georgia in conjunction with the <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.ars.usda.gov/southeast-area/tifton-ga/crop-genetics-and-breeding-research/docs/bermudagrass-for-turf/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s Agricultural Research Service (ARS)</a>.  Advantages of TifEagle are its fine texture and density - TifEagle has a finer leaf texture and higher shoot density compared to other bermuda grass varieties leading to smoother putting surfaces.  TifEagle can tolerate extremely low mowing heights at 1/8 inch or 3.2 mm helping create the smooth, fast surfaces preferred on greens.   Additionally, TifEagle is highly tolerant of heat making it suitable for use in hot, sunny climates. It remains green and healthy even during the height of summer.</p><p>Early reports from Hanse's West course have classic design elements from sandy soil in a Leven inspired short par 4 5th hole and a Hell's Half Acre for heroics at the par 5 6th hole.  Anticipation for first looks in 2023 are high.</p>"
