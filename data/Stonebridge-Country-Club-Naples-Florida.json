					"text": "<p>Stonebridge Country Club in Naples, Florida is undergoing a major renovation of its golf course, led by golf course architect <a href='https://ksgolfdesign.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Kipp Schulties</a>. The project, which began in early 2023, is expected to be completed in late 2024.  The design plan from Schulties will increase the acres available to the golf course.</p><p>The renovation will include a number of changes to the golf course, including reshaping the perimeter mounds, rebuilding greens to USGA spec. with a maximum slope of 2.3 degrees and generally 1 degree minimum slope to aid drainage.</p><p>About 100 trees will be relocated to different parts of the property detailed in the project's <a href='https://www.usga.org/content/usga/home-page/course-care/green-section-record/59/18/developing-a-tree-management-plan.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Tree Impact Plan</a>.  Broadly, a tree impact plan is a document that outlines steps to be taken to protect trees during the golf course renovation. The goal is to avoid unnecessary damage to the trees and vegetation during construction activities.  A tree impact plan typically includes an inventory of all trees, an assessment of the potential impact of the construction on the trees.  The plan further protects the trees during construction by scheduling the relocation and replanting of the identified trees.  The tree impact plan should be developed in consultation with a qualified arborist or other tree expert. This will ensure that the plan is effective in protecting the trees and that it meets golf renovation and design strategy requirements.</p>"
