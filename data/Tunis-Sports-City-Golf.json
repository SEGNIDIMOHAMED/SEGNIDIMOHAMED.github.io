					"text": "<p>The golf course at <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.tunissportscity.com/project/5-golf-zone' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Tunis Sport City</a> is a nine hole design from Golf Architect <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.harradine-golf.com/trpharr.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Peter Harradine</a>.  Harradine is a multi-generational Swiss golf course architecture family.  Harradine initiated planning in the project in 2006 having been commissioned to plan an 18-hole course near Lake Tunis.</p><p>More recently, the masterplan was revised to nine holes.  The benefit of the new design is the location on one side of the road, avoiding the complication of crossing a major road.  It has a smaller and more sustainable footprint with a centrally located clubhouse and extensive PGA supervised practice facilities planned.  The site will preserve many existing trees and incorporate ecological evaporation ponds and two beautiful lakes.</p><p>Harradine has planned for a classic par 36 track measuring 3,502 yards from the back tees. Night golf will be an option with a floodlit illumination of the golf course.  The course will have five tees at each hole, providing diversity and challenge for different levels of players. Harradine has created over 200 golf courses around the world including many in Africa and Asia.</p>"
