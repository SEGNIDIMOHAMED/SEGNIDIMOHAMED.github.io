The club has two historic courses, The Pines Course and The Oak Course.  The Oaks Course is being redesigned by <a href='http://www.tdagolf.net/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Tripp Davis</a>.  The property is a private golf club and features a boutique lodge and clubhouse restaurant.</p><p>The International has a rich history dating back to 1899 when it started as the Runaway Brook Golf Club. It was acquired in 1953 by Albert Surprenant who hired Geoffrey Cornish to design the Pines course. The Pines course debuted in 1955 as the longest golf course in the world at 8,040 yards from the Tiger tees. The club was purchased by International Telephone & Telegraph (ITT) in 1961 and operated as a corporate retreat and private club for nearly 40 years. In 1967, ITT changed the name to The International Club.</p><p>In 1999, Tom Fazio designed The Oaks, his first golf course in New England.  <a href='https://escalantegolf.com/properties' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Escalante Golf</a> acquired The International in February 2021 and planned the renovation/rebuild project of the two courses.</p>"
