The development will include approximately 140 homes leaving over 200 acres of active farms.  Each home includes an acre as an active farm contributing to the food production on the island.   The farms will be managed by a team of experienced farmers producing a variety of fruits, vegetables, and flowers.  In addition to the homes and farms, Ouli Farms will also include a community club.
