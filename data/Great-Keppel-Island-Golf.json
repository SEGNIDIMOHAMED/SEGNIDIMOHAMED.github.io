A number of developers are proposing a new project on the island, rebuilding a luxury resort with a golf course and marina.</p><p>The environmental and social impacts of these projects will need to be carefully considered. However, if done correctly, these projects could help to revitalize Great Keppel Island and create a sustainable tourism destination for future generations.</p><p>A golf resort is one of the proposed projects for Great Keppel Island. The resort would be designed to be sustainable and environmentally friendly. It would feature an 18-hole golf course designed by Greg Norman.</p><p>The golf resort is a positive development for Great Keppel Island. It has the potential to create jobs, boost the local economy, and attract more tourists to the island.</p>"
