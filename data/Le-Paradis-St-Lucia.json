The project was envisaged to be developed in four phases but was unfortunately stalled in 2008, went into receivership in 2009 and Phase 1 was 52% complete.</p><p>Sotheby's has the property for sale at $29,000,000 USD. Renowned golf course architect Greg Norman routed the golf course and started the build. Clearance, final shaping and grassing are remaining in the golf construction build.  Nearby Cabot St. Lucia Golf Course opening will be a positive.</p><p>The rebirth of Le Paradis is a positive development for St. Lucia and will be a valuable asset to the community providing a place for people to relax and enjoy the beauty of St. Lucia.</p>"
