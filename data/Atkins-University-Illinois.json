The generous donation was intended to support the Illini golf programs and provide public golf for the community. The course has hosted several prestigious tournaments, including the 1998 and 2009 NCAA Men’s Regional Championships, the 2013 NCAA Women’s Regional Championship, and the 2014 Big Ten Women’s Championship3.</p><p>Atkins Golf Club is managed by Troon Golf, the world’s largest golf management company, which offers high-quality conditioning, service and amenities to golfers.  The course is open to the public and offers various membership options, including discounts for students, faculty members, alumni and play options visitor.</p><p>The course layout is a classic par 72 from a set of four par-3s, ten par-4s, and four par-5s with a total yardage of 7,118 from the back tees with course rating 74.6 and bogey slope rating 138.  The course features rolling terrain, water hazards, strategic bunkering, and large undulating greens. Some of the special holes to observe when playing the course are:</p><ul><li>The par-4 first hole requires a carry tee shot over water to a narrow fairway that slopes left to right with an approach shot uphill to a well-bunkered green.</li><li>The par-5 fifth hole is the longest hole on the course at 606 yards. The hole doglegs left around a large lake that comes into play on the second and third shots. The green is elevated and surrounded by bunkers.</li><li>The par-3 eighth hole, which is the shortest hole on the course at 155 yards, playing downhill to a peninsula green that juts out into the lake.  Wind direction can make club selection tricky on this scenic hole.</li><li>The par-4 13th hole is a difficult hole playing 455 yards from the back tees with the second shot uphill to a sloping green that is protected by bunkers in front and behind.</li><li>The par-5 18th hole, which is a classic finishing hole that offers a risk-reward opportunity for birdie or eagle. It plays 543 yards from the back tees and bends slightly right around a pond that can come into play on the second shot. The green is reachable in two for long hitters, but it is also guarded by water on the left and bunkers on the right.</li></ul>”
