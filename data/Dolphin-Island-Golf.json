					"text": "<p>Dolphin Island Golf and Country Club was a development project planned by the Cordova Land Development Corporation (CLDC). The proposal was a land reclamation of 1,500 hectares of land on the island with the construction of a golf course with a marina and beach for hotel resort guests.  However, the project was stalled from opposition by environmental groups and residents, arguing that the project would damage the island's ecosystem. In 2019, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) denied the CLDC's environmental compliance certificate for the project.</p><p>As of 2023, the golf project on Dolphin Island has been abandoned. Instead the CLDC will pursue developing the island in another manner.</p><p>Dolphin Island, also known as Olango Island, is a small island located in the Mactan Channel, just off the coast of Cebu City, Philippines.  The island is home to a number of dolphin species: the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, the spinner dolphin, and the striped dolphin.  Other wildlife includes sea turtles, birds, and fish.</p>"
