The project started in 2022 and will be completed in 2023 with a number of changes to the course, namely shaping and widening fairways, re-design greens, bunker reconstruction, tree removal, and improving drainage.  The goal of the renovation is to create a more challenging and strategic course that will be more enjoyable for all levels of golfers. Green is a highly respected golf course architect who has a reputation for creating courses that are both challenging and playable.  Amateur golfer Trip Kuehne is involved in the Vaquero Club renovation.</p><p>The original Vaquero Club golf course was designed by Tom Fazio and opened in 2001. The course is located in Westlake, Texas, on the former Circle T Ranch. The course is known for its rolling hills, lush fairways, and challenging greens. The course has been ranked in the Top 100 courses in the country by Golf Digest and Golfweek's Modern Top 100.  Previous to renovation, the golf course played as a par 72 at 7,369 yards from the back tees with slope rating of 138 and USGA handicap rating of 74.4.  The course is known for its variety with each hole offering a different challenge. Some of the most notable holes on the course include the par-4 10th hole, which is a long, uphill hole with a narrow fairway testing driver, and the downhill par-3 17th hole surrounded by bunkers.</p>"
