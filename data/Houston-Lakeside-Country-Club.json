                    "text": "<p>Lakeside Country Club is a private country club located in Houston, Texas. The club was founded in 1951 by a group of Houston businessmen who wanted to create a club with golf and social opportunities. The club has a membership with families continuing that tradition.</p><p>The clubâ€™s focal point is its championship golf course which was originally designed by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_golf_course_architects' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Ralph Plummer</a> and is now being redesigned by  <a href='http://www.jayblasi.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jay Blasi</a>. The course has hosted several major tournaments including the PGA Tour's Houston Open. The club also offers tennis, swimming, dining, and event facilities for its members. Lakeside Country Club is known for its high standards of excellence, service, and philanthropy.</p><p><a href='http://www.jayblasi.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jay Blasi</a> has become one of the new generation of architects leading the game forward.  Blasi was the key force behind the design of <a href='https://www.chambersbaygolf.com/2015-u-s-open/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>2015 U.S. Open host Chambers Bay</a> outside of Tacoma, Washington.  Blasi has led other important projects such as Santa Ana Country Club re-design and the Golden Gate Park renovation.</p><p>The above video from golf architect Jay Blasi presents the design and strategy of the 18th hole of the re-design.  He introduces <a href='https://thecourseshaper.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Derek Dirksen, the Course Shaper,</a> as an integral shaper working on the green complexes onsite. Jay describes the 18th hole as a short par four that can potentially be driven. He emphasizes the strategic advantage of hitting the tee shot to the right side of the fairway to gain a good angle into the green. However, he also mentions a bunker in the middle of the fairway that presents a challenging shot into the green.  We're nearly 100 years on from Tom Simpson as one of the best design minds in golf - Blasi does well to bring his Simpson's best ideas of shot choice and variety into modern design with this discussion. Blasi further explains that while there is plenty of room on the left side of the fairway, it still presents a challenging shot due to the angle into the green. He discusses the challenges of hitting the ball off the tee and the impact it has on the angle into the green. He explains that there are choices to make off the tee, but the angle into the green is not as good when bailing out. The green itself is smaller in size, but there is plenty of room for a potentially drivable short Par 4.</p><p>The video also covers the rough shaping of the green and the underground installation of drainage lines and gravel in the USGA specification green process. Blasi thinks through different pin placements/hole locations on the green with interesting spots on the left side of the green. He warns against missing left or long and mentions the presence of a swale over the green.  Blasi shares his views on the benefits of the transplanted oak tree to the left of the 18th green as an important feature of the landscape.</p><p>We are looking forward to a successful opening of the new Lakeside.</p>"
