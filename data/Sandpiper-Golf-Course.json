The property faces the Channel Islands and <a href='https://www.independent.com/2022/01/19/so-long-offshore-platforms/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>aging offshore oil platforms scheduled to be decommissioned</a>.  Sandpiper was designed by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Bell' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>William F. Bell</a> and opened in 1972.  The course takes advantage of the natural terrain, incorporating seaside cliffs and the nearby ocean into its design.  The layout is routed as a clifftop golf course for the majority of the terrain with the exception of the downhill par 3 11th hole which plays downhill to a beachside green.</p><p>The renovation does not have a start date yet.  However, Doak posted to Instagram a photo in early 2021 of the 18th hole with the caption that the pond in front of the green would remain due to an threatened wildlife species.</p><p>Doak is a renowned golf course architect who has designed or renovated some of the most famous courses in the world, including St. Patrick's in Ireland, Pacific Dunes in Oregon, and Tara Iti in New Zealand.  The renovation could potentially include a number of changes, including changing the course's original routing, removing trees, improving drainage, renovating bunkers and greens.</p><p>Approvals for permitting may require California Coastal Commission involvement.</p>"
