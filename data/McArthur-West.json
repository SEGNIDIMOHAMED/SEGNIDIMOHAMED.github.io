					"text": "<p><a href='https://www.mcarthurgolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>McArthur Golf Club</a> is a private golf club in Hobe Sound, Florida. The first golf course was designed by Tom Fazio with Nick Price opening in 2002.  Greens are Tifeagle ultra-dwarf bermudagrass.  Fairways are Tifway 419 bermudagrass.</p><p>The 2nd golf course at McArthur is named McArthur West and is being built by <a href='https://www.cooreandcrenshaw.com/current-projects.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw</a>.  Coore Crenshaw is known for their minimalist design approach.  The course is natural and being designed to blend in with the natural surroundings utilizing sand dunes and native wetlands.  The 518 acre parcel is located west of the first golf course and will add to the approximate 456 developed acres west of US Highway One at the intersection of SE Osprey Street.  McArthur is close to nearby Medalist Club.</p><p>Part of the Martin County property includes a Preserve Area Management Plan (PAMP) for preservation and maintaining the designated section of the sit.  The Preserve area is maintained in its natural state with minimal disturbance.  Restoration includes removing exotic plants by replanting with native species and eliminating dead/diseased/hazardous plants. <a href='https://www.martin.fl.us/resources/m189-008-mcarthur-west-golf-club' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Martin County</a> permits non-native, exotic vegetation in the Preserve Areas to be removed using the least ecologically harmful methods by hand pulling, hand spading, cutting with hand or chain saws, and in-situ treatment with suitable herbicides.</p>"
