In 2020, <a href='https://asgca.org/architect/dpascuzzo/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Damian Pascuzzo, ASGCA</a>, proposed reducing the 18-hole golf course to be shortened to 12 holes to accommodate the proposed development converting 31 acres of the golf course into 248 single-family homes for seniors age 55 and older.  The City Council has not yet made a decision on the proposed development.  However, the council has received a number of public comments on the project, both for and against it.</p><p>If the council approves the development, approval would be required from the Planning Commission and the <a href='https://www.coastal.ca.gov/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>California Coastal Commission</a> before the course renovation could take place.</p>"
