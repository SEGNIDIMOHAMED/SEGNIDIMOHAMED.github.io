					"text": "<p><a href='https://www.westportgolflinks.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Westport Golf Links</a> project is a proposal to build a seaside golf course with hospitality resort as part of the overall development of Westport Light State Park near Westport, Washington. The proposal comes from Westport Golf Inc., a private company in Seattle ledy by Chris Day.</p><p>The property's golf course would be designed by <a href='http://dmkgolfdesign.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>David McLay Kidd</a> , who has designed nearby resort courses Bandon Dunes, Oregon and Gamble Sands, Washington. The property is 600 acres of state park land along the Pacific Ocean.  The climate is suitable for fescue grass which was planted in the Bandon, Oregon property.</p><p>The project is currently in the environmental review. The <a href='https://parks.wa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/19951/Westport-Light-Master-Planning-Update---Nov-22' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR)</a> is expected to issue a decision on the project in early 2024.  If the project is approved, construction is expected to begin in late 2024 and the golf course is expected to open in 2026. The inn is expected to open in 2027.</p><p>350 jobs are anticipated during construction.  100 permanent jobs are forecast once the project is completed. The project is budgeted to generate $20 million in economic golf tourism activity annually.  The DNR has held a number of public community feedback meetings to review the project, receiving many comments from the public stakeholders.</p>"
