__Making 3D scans with a turntable__

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Turntable/banner.png)

I recently acquired an [Original Prusa i3 MK3S+](Original Prusa i3 MK3S+) 3D printer, because I have always been interested in making stuff, but I have never had access to a garage or tools. A 3D printer solves that problem because I can just design parts using a tool like [FreeCad](https://www.freecad.org/) and just print them out (there is a slicer between them as well - I use the [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/)). Of course, there are a lot of 3D models available online as well! I am finding lots of interesting stuff on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/).

One project that I started playing with several years ago was 3D reconstruction from a turntable. I first started looking at turntables because I wanted to simplify the problem of multi-image 3D reconstruction, and thought that a turntable could be useful because it constrains the camera trajectory to a circle. However, as time went by, I also saw it as a way of making a simple cheap 3D scanner of small objects. Thus one of the first 3D printer builds that I set out to try, was to make a motorized turntable (up to now, all my turntables have been manual).
