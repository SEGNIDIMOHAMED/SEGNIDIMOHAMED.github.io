My name is Nick Ross and I'm an experienced data science professor and executive. Currently I'm an instructional professor and Director of the Data Science Clinic at the University of Chicago's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.uchicago.edu/). I also advise and invest in startups, personally as well as through the [Polsky Center's Transform Data Science and AI Accelerator](https://polsky.uchicago.edu/programs-events/transform/). Finally, I sit on the advisory board of [Michigan State University's Analytics Program](https://broad.msu.edu/masters/business-data-science-analytics/board/).

Before Chicago, I was Director of Backend Engineering and Data Science at [The Meta (not Facebook)](https://themeta.com/). I spend most of my time working with [boring technologies](http://boringtechnology.club/) (node, python, k8s, docker and redis for example). I design cost-effective, scalable, cloud-based backend and data systems (ML/AI) as well as assemble the teams that build them. This includes all the fun stuff keeping the systems up at night.

On the [research]({% link research.md %}) side I study how companies leverage data to make decisions. Currently I'm working on two projects: a tome on [A/B testing]({% link abtesting.md %}) and a book on [Data Management]({% link datamanagement.md %}) using Pandas and SQL.

Formerly I was a professor at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu) though I spent most of my time housed within their [Data Institute](https://www.usfca.edu/data-institute) and [teaching]({% link classes.md %}) in the Masters of Data Science Program (MSDS). Many commonly answered questions about USF's MSDS Program can be found on my old [Quora page](https://www.quora.com/profile/Nicholas-Ross), though some of this may be out of date.

At USF I was also Assistant Director of Partnerships at the Data Institute. In this role I established industry-academic partnerships with dozens of companies. Finally I was also the Director of the Practicum Program, sourcing over 80 data science internships per year. You can see me talking about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O17hZq3iM1A).

Before USF, I spent a number of years in the video game industry, primarily at two companies: TinyCo, which was purchased by [JamCity in 2016](https://www.jamcity.com/why-were-buying-tinyco/) and [Sega](https://www.sega.com/), though I also consulted for a number of other start-ups. After completing my undergraduate degree, I worked for a number of years at [Bates White](https://www.bateswhite.com/), an economic consulting firm located in DC and San Diego.
