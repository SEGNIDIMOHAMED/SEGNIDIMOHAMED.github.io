The purpose of this course was to prepare Masters of Data Science students with the tools to be effective communicators, especially with respect to interviewing. In this seven-week course the focus was understanding how what we said, wrote, DM'ed, put on our LinkedIn, etc. would be interpreted by (future) our colleagues. 

A significant component of this course covered "informal" business communication situations, such as introducing yourself and giving an elevator pitch. The culmination of the course was a more formal presentation on a data science topic of the students choice.
