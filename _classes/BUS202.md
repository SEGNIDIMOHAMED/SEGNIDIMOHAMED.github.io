Traditional Introduction to Managerial Accounting. Used [Managerial Accounting for Undergraduates](https://mybusinesscourse.com/book/managerial-accounting-undergraduates-2e) as a textbook. This was a semester long course covering the core topics in this area. 

At USF this course is required for all undergraduate business majors. Course format was 20-30 students (in-person) and I taught 2-3 sections per semester during this time.
