This course covers the basics of SQL and Pandas in an applied manner specifically focusing on the use and manipulation of data. Students are required to use these tools in order to complete a final, public facing data science project.

The course itself occurred during the semester which was interrupted by the pandemic which means that the syllabus ([here](\assets\syllabi\BSDS200Syllabus.pdf)) doesn't fully reflect the class content. 

For a textbook, each student was provided a copy of [my data management book]({% link datamanagement.md %}).
