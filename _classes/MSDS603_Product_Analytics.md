This course is co-taught with [Diane Woodbridge](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/diane-woodbridge) and has two major, interconnected components. Students learn about the business strategy behind how companies use data by building their own application. Each team comes up with a data-focused business and then are required to build it over seven weeks. At the conclusion of the course, a panel of venture capitalists come in and critique the cream of the applications. 

The current version of the course meets twice a week for seven weeks. The meetings alternate between technical direction and business strategy discussion. Students begin selecting groups and writing a business plan. Each week they are required to update the business plan as well as build specific features for their application. Git, Docker, Python, Flask and PostgreSQL are all used in this class.
