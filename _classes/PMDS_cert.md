The purpose of this 7 week professional certificate course, co-taught with [Helen Mou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helenmou/) was primarily to [increase data literacy of product managers](https://towardsdatascience.com/leveling-up-ai-literacy-for-pms-dc293b79fe17). We taught from the book [Data Science for Business](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-for/9781449374273/) a commonly used MBA level textbook for data science.

Each week would have both a lecture component, covering common data science techniques, how they are used, why they work and why they fail from the perspective of a (relatively) non-technical person. We focused on common failure modes and how to avoid them, what questions to ask and how think through different approaches to problems in this domain. 

Each week we would have a guest speaker (or speakers) who would talk through a problem that they had worked through. Speakers included representatives from Amazon, Deloitte and Shopify (among others).
