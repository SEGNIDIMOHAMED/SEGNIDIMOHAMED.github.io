This course, taught once per year, was a 7-week crash course in using SQL. The course covered the fundamentals of using relational databases for analyzing data. Since this course focused on the vocational aspects of using a database the tenor of the course was less theoretical and more focused on problem solving with SQL.

Each week consisted of a lecture, homework assignment and a quiz with a final exam, representing most of the grading in the course.

The final time I taught this course was a joint crash course which taught both PostgreSQL and Pandas out of [my data management book]({% link datamanagement.md %}). The most recent syllabus can be found [here](/assets/RelationalDBSyllabus.pdf).
