I"X<p>Recently, I have been working on the <a href="https://github.com/zainafzal88/scrumblr-enhancement">scrumblr-enhancement</a> project on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/roarcoders">Roarcoders stream</a>, where we have been attempting to display the boardName from the backend. However, we kept receiving a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">promise</code> value that couldnâ€™t be accessed directly. After some research, the way forward was to add an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">async/await</code>, enabling us to directly access and utilize the value.</p>
