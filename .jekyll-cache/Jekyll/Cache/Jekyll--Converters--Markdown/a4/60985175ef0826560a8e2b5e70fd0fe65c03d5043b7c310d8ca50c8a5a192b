I"<p>LocalStack is an extremely useful tool if you want to save money and avoid signing into AWS console as much as possible.</p>

<p>Using LocalStack gives you the ability to spin up cloud services directly on your local machine, making it more convenient to develop for the cloud.</p>

<p>I recently discovered LocalStack whilst working on the <a href="https://github.com/zainafzal88/scrumblr-enhancement">Scrumblr-Enhacement project</a> alongside a group of members from the Dev(){CoP} community. Zain Afzal, our project lead, recommended we use LocalStack in order to simplify development and save cost.</p>

<p>In this blog, I will show you how to setup LocalStack on your machine, step-by-step.</p>

<h1 id="step-1">Step 1</h1>

<h2 id="install-and-run-docker">Install and Run Docker</h2>

<p>Visit <a href="">https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&amp;type=edition&amp;offering=community</a>.</p>

<p>Search for the Docker download matching your OS and install it accordingly.</p>

<p>Once you have Docker installed, make sure to run the application. If you’ve installed and run it correctly, you should see the whale icon appear on your tool bar above.</p>

<p>All you have to do is keep it running and proceed to the next step.</p>

<h1 id="step-2">Step 2</h1>

<p>Visit the LocalStack repository on github via
https://github.com/localstack/localstack.</p>

<p>On here, locate a file called ‘docker-compose.yaml’ and click to open it. You should see a page like below. Highlight all the text shown in this file and copy it to your clipboard.</p>

<h1 id="step-3">Step 3</h1>

<p>If you already know what project you’ll be using LocalStack for, open up that repository on your favourite IDE. Otherwise, create a test folder anywhere on your machine and open that instead.</p>

<p>For this tutorial, I will create a folder called ‘localstack’ on my desktop.</p>

<p>Once you have opened up your IDE with your chosen folder, create a new file in there called ‘docker-composer.yaml’</p>

<p><img src="../images/step-3-localstack.png" alt="step-3-localstack" /></p>

<p>After you’ve created this file, paste the text you copied earlier and hit save.</p>

<h1 id="step-4">Step 4</h1>

<p>Now add the AWS services you plan to use by editing the ‘SERVICES’ line in the ‘docker-compose.yaml’ file. As you can see from the image below, I have added s3, lambda and ec2.</p>

<p><img src="../images/step-4-localstack.png" alt="step-4-localstack" /></p>

<h1 id="step-5">Step 5</h1>

<p>Open up the terminal; either through your IDE or directly on your machine. Locate the directory where you have your ‘docker-compose.yaml’ file stored. You can do this by using the CD command as shown below.</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">cd </span>Desktop/localstack
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you’ve done this, type in the following command.</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>docker-compose up
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>You should see a sequence of lines show up in your terminal just like the image shown below. As you can see, the mock services we listed earlier is now running.</p>

<h1 id="step-6">Step 6</h1>
<p>Visit <a href="">https://0.0.0.0:4566</a> in your browser and you should see a “running” status like below.</p>

<p><img src="../images/step-6-localstack.png" alt="step-6-localstack" /></p>

<p>Add /health to the end of the previous url and you will see the statuses of each of the services you listed earlier.</p>
