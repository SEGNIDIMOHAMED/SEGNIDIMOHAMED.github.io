I":<p>If you are reading this blog, it’s likely you ran into the “No Network Adaptor” error whilst installing ESXi.</p>

<p>I recently set up ESXi on an old Asus Laptop and ran into the same error. After tirelessly searching the internet, I managed to piece together a solution that worked for me.</p>

<p>This blog will show you how to install ESXi on a laptop with an incompatible NIC. It should be noted that this is purely for learning purposes, and you should not be installing ESXi where your hardware may be incompatible.</p>

<h1 id="step-0">Step 0</h1>

<h2 id="backup-your-device">Backup your Device</h2>

<p>If you have anything important on your computer, make sure you backup this up first.</p>

<p>When you install ESXi, it will wipe out everything on the hard drive, so you will lose anything that you haven’t saved.</p>

<h1 id="step-1">Step 1</h1>

<h2 id="determine-your-laptops-nic">Determine your laptop’s NIC</h2>

<p>You can find this information by using Device Manager on a Windows machine.</p>

<p>Make a note of the NIC, as you will need this to find the appropriate ESXi driver.</p>

<h1 id="step-2">Step 2</h1>

<h2 id="download-compatible-driver">Download compatible driver</h2>

<p>Once you’ve determined the NIC, you’ll have to find a compatible driver for it.</p>

<p>The first place to check for a compatible driver is <a href="https://vibsdepot.v-front.de/wiki/index.php/List_of_currently_available_ESXi_packages">here</a>. This website has a list of currently available drivers for a variety of NICs.</p>

<p>If you don’t find it there, have a search online, and you could get lucky. I had to do this in my case as I couldn’t find a compatible driver from the link above.</p>

<p>However, I did manage to find the driver I needed for an Atheros NIC at <a href="https://www.gomeisa.net/2019/07/atheros-ar8151ar8161-realtek-r8168r8169.html?m=1">https://www.gomeisa.net/2019/07/atheros-ar8151ar8161-realtek-r8168r8169.html?m=1</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, if you still can’t find a driver after this, you don’t have many options remaining. You either have to build your own driver or consider changing the physical NIC of your machine.</p>

<p>If you have found a driver, however, proceed with the remaining steps. Otherwise, the following won’t work for you.</p>

<h1 id="step-3">Step 3</h1>

<h2 id="download-esxi-5x6x">Download ESXi 5.x/6.x</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, there are currently limited/no NIC drivers for ESXi 7. Due to this, you will likely have to download an older version of ESXi.</p>

<p>You can find ESXi downloads by searching on Google. I used ESXi 6.0; this link can be found here - <a href="https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/details?productId=491&amp;rPId=9954&amp;downloadGroup=ESXI600">https://customerconnect.vmware.com/downloads/details?productId=491&amp;rPId=9954&amp;downloadGroup=ESXI600</a>.</p>

<p>The ESXi version you choose to install is up to you; however, remember to download a version compatible with the NIC driver you found. The location where you found the driver should give you an indicator of the ESXi version you need.</p>

<h1 id="step-4">Step 4</h1>

<h2 id="download-and-edit-esxi-customizer-tool">Download and Edit ESXi-Customizer Tool</h2>

<p>You can find the ESXi-Customizer GUI Tool on - <a href="https://www.v-front.de/p/esxi-customizer.html">https://www.v-front.de/p/esxi-customizer.html</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re using this tool on Windows 10, you have to comment out line 260. You can do this by adding a “REM” in front of that line.</p>

<p>To quickly find this line, use CTRL + F, and search for “Unsupported Windows Version”.</p>

</p>

<h1 id="step-5">Step 5</h1>

<h2 id="create-custom-esxi-image">Create custom ESXi Image</h2>

<p>Using the tool, add the ESXi image, the driver you previously downloaded and select a location for the newly created image to be added to.</p>

<p>The resulting file will contain an ESXi ISO image with the custom driver added.</p>

<h1 id="step-6">Step 6</h1>

<h2 id="create-bootable-esxi-usb">Create bootable ESXi USB</h2>

<p>You can do this using tools like Rufus. You’ll need to use a USB with enough capacity and doesn’t contain any data you might need.</p>

<p>Here is the tutorial I used, but you can find many similar ones through a simple search: <br />

<h1 id="step-7">Step 7</h1>

<h2 id="install-esxi-on-your-machine">Install ESXi on your machine</h2>

<p>Insert the USB into your laptop and proceed with the installation following the on-screen prompts.</p>

<h1 id="thats-it">That’s It!</h1>

<p>Once your installation is complete, check that it is working by visiting the IP address shown on a web browser.</p>

<p>If a login screen greets you, then your ESXi installation has been successful. The username and password will be the same ones you set during installation.</p>
