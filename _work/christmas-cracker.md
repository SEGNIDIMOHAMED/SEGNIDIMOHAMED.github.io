Tasked with advertising Ideal World’s upcoming ‘Christmas in August’ bank holiday weekend event, with the focus on getting ready for Christmas. 

I was asked to tie the design in with the events TV branding and evoke a luxurious feel to the promotion. The luxury christmas cracker box plays along with the event name and surprise gift vibe to encourage people to flip the card and visit the Ideal World website or tune in to the special event.

The design was produced as a run of 90,000 direct marketing postcards and package inserts.
