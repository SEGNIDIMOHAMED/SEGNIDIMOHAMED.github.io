I have designed a lot of direct email marketing pieces, this one is my favourite because of the content.

Street Fighter IV game was an old game brought up-to-date whilst paying homage to the original characters and gameplay. My design aimed to do the same, with the big bold graphical style a derivative of this aesthetic. I was provided with some great artwork so I chose to make the opening graphic as big and bold as the game itself.

The Street Fighter series was back and I wanted to make sure customers opening this mailer knew it and immediately pre-ordered.
