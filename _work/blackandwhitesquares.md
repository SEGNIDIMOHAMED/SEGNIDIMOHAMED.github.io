### If it’s black, white and grid-like it has a place here.

A site dedicated to all things 2D code. I purchased the domain [blackandwhitesquares.com](http://blackandwhitesquares.com/) [B&WS], which encapsulates the whole genre of 2D code, back in 2007 when QR(Quick Response) codes were coming to the attention of western markets. In 2009 I launched a site dedicated to QR and 2D barcodes showing the best of what they can do, using a self-built custom theme using Tumblr as a platform.

The site began as a testbed for SEO techniques, experience copywriting, producing and sourcing content around marketing, business and technology subjects. To date, two posts have featured under Tumblr’s very popular and curated [#tech tag](http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/tech), generating great traffic and quadrupling follower count. Visit [blackandwhitesquares.com](http://blackandwhitesquares.com/) and see the result.
