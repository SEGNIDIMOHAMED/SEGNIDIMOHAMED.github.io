	        <h1>Muriwai Downs - New Golf Course in New Zealand</h1>
	        <p>The Muriwai Downs proposed golf course project is an approved development proposal by Bears Home Project Management Limited in Auckland, New Zealand.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/have-your-say/have-your-say-notified-resource-consent/notified-resource-consent-applications-open-submissions/Pages/ResourceConsentApplication.aspx?itemId=514&applNum=BUN60393755' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Kyle Phillips designed the initial site plan</a> remotely during COVID, planning for a 19 hole golf course and short course.  Additionally, a Sport Academy with luxury lodge accommodation of 26 units on the Muriwai Downs property.  The Sports Academy is anticipated to be the new headquarters of Golf NZ.</p><p>The project location is under 40 kilometers west of Auckland city center on the North Island overlooking the Tasman Sea. The farm's 507 hectares(1,200+ acres) and is currently a working sheep + cattle farm overlooking the sea to the west.  The land is also home to a number of exceptional natural features, including a waterfall, kauri forest, streams, wetlands, and coastal dunes.  Planning for the course with Auckland council was led in person by Queenstown, New Zealand based golf architect Greg Turner with discussion points on routing, site soil and council land planning requirements.</p>
	        <p>The sports academy would provide training facilities for golfers of all levels and would also include indoor and outdoor tennis courts.  The resource consent application for the project was <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://waitangitribunal.govt.nz/assets/Documents/Publications/2023-NZEnvC-042-The-Bears-Home-Project-Management-Limited-v-Auckland-Council-v2.pdf' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'> approved by Auckland Council in 2023</a>.</p>
