			<H1>New Gil Hanse Design - High Grove</H1>
			<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://highgrovegolf.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>High Grove Golf Club</a> is a new golf course and club being built at the southern end of the Lake Wales Ridge, a 100-mile-long chain of sand dunes.  The property is <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.hcpao.org/Search/Parcel/303816A0000210000C' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>1,211 acres of citrus groves</a> that rise in elevation from 105 to 175 feet above sea level.  The ground is ideal sandy soil for fast running golf turfgrass.  Soils are classified as the Astatula-Paola-Tavares which are known for well draining grass on golf courses. Co-founders Ryan Hanks, Colin Sheehan and Bert Guy found the ideal site for golf with sandy soils which are porous and allow for good water infiltration. The soil conditions are also well-suited for growing valencia oranges which are tolerant of sandy soils.  There are natural wetlands on the north end of the property, but the design will have no artificial ponds on the golf course.  Design for the club in includes a short course with 11 holes.  <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.hansegolfdesign.com/news/hanse-course-for-new-high-grove-club-in-florida-to-enter-construction-in-2024/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Golf course construction</a> and shaping begins in autumn 2024 with an anticipated opening at the end of 2025.</p>
			<p>Golf architect <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.hansegolfdesign.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Gil Hanse</a> is a renowned golf course architect who will build the High Grove Golf Club.  Hanse is known for his natural style in design preferring to work with the land as much as possible, minimizing the amount of earthmoving that is required. This results in golf courses that are more environmentally friendly and that fit in better with the surrounding landscape.</p>
			<p>Design partner <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.hansegolfdesign.com/tag/jim-wagner/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Jim Wagner</a> is a Florida resident and hands on in shaping and strategic design in the field.  Wagner is well known specialist in golf construction often leading the "Caveman Construction" approach of detail.  This hands-on approach differentiates the team and translates well into the natural landscape presentation.  Some of the most notable projects from the Wagner and Hanse's team include the Olympic Golf Course in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil(host of the 2016 Olympics), <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://cabothighlands.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Cabot Highlands</a> in Scotland, Ohoopee Match Club in Georgia, and Ladera Golf Club in California.</p>
			<p>Heritage Links Golf Construction will work with the Hanse team's <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://cavemanconstructiongear.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Caveman Construction</a> on golf course construction.  Hanse team's specialist superintendent Russ Myers will assist in construction and grow in with onsite visits.
