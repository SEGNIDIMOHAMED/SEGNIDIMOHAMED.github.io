  <h1>What to write about?</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>Every student, upcoming developer and IT professional should have a blog where they can share their thoughts, knowledge and inspiration.</p>

<p>Creating and maintaining a blog can improve your communication skills, help others and re-affirm what you’ve learnt.</p>

<p>However, ‘what to write about?’ can often be the hardest part. So I posed this question to the <a href="https://devcop.io/">Dev(){CoP}</a> community and here is what they had to say.</p>

<h2 id="pick-a-theme">Pick a theme</h2>

<p>Before you begin, pick a theme or get a broad sense of what you want to write about. Understanding this will make coming up with ideas far easier as you’ll be focussed on one specific area.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to be known as a web developer specialising in frontend, you might base your blogs around HTML, CSS and ReactJS.</p>

<p>Once you have your theme in mind, you can start to build your blog around this.</p>

<h2 id="problems-that-youve-solved">Problems that you’ve solved</h2>

<p>Being in any IT role is about facing and solving problems.</p>

<p>By writing about the problems you have solved, you can re-affirm what you’ve learnt and possibly help someone else out in the process.</p>

<p>Besides this, it also acts as a reference in the event you encounter the problem again.</p>

<h2 id="online-courses">Online courses</h2>

<p>Since IT is an ever-growing field, there’s always something more to be learnt.</p>

<p>As you go through an online course, perhaps you can document your learnings or note down some key takeaways from the program.</p>

<p>Doing this can act as referesher but it may also help someone else who is deciding whether to enrol in the course.</p>

<h2 id="things-that-annoy-you">Things that annoy you</h2>

<p>As you go along your IT journey, there are bound to be things that annoy you.</p>

<p>For example, say you’ve been working on a project and you’ve been deploying code manually. But then you realise how tedious this can be, leading you to automate this process.</p>

<p>From this, you can write about all your frustrations, including a walkthrough of your solution; in turn someone else may be able to avoid the same hassles.</p>

<h2 id="open-source-projects">Open Source Projects</h2>

<p>Open Source Projects are a great way to get invovled, give back and gain practical experience.</p>

<p>You can keep track of your experience by documenting what you’ve been working on and any roadblocks that you’ve encountered.</p>

<p>This is an excellent way to measure your progress and further cement your knowledge.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Essentially, writing blogs is a means of documenting your learnings and sharing what you know.</p>

<p>The easiest way to come up with ideas is to keep your blog focussed and simply write about what you’ve been working on.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the <a href="https://devcop.io/">Dev(){CoP}</a> community for helping me come up with this list. If you have any further ideas or would like to have a discussion about this blog, please feel free to reach out!</p>
