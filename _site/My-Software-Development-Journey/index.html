  <h1>My Journey into Software Development</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I feel like anyone who’s ever gotten into software development has their own unique story. If you’ve listened to the ‘How I built this’ podcast, you might believe that all programmers were born rather than made.</p>

<p>But this certainly isn’t the case, or perhaps I just don’t believe it is.</p>

<p>Anyways, in this blog I will talk about how I discovered my passion for software dev…</p>

<h3 id="high-school">High School</h3>

<p>I first learnt about programming and IT in high school. Back then, I made a school portal app which had simple functionality such as logging in and viewing your timetable. I built this using Visual Basic and remember being totally immersed in this process.</p>

<p>I didn’t know this at the time but I fell in love with problem solving.</p>

<p>From this point on, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. But I didn’t realise just how difficult this journey would be.</p>

<h3 id="university">University</h3>

<p>After high school, I enrolled into Computing and Software Systems at Melbourne Uni. At the time, I was so certain I wanted to study this but was quickly discouraged when I couldn’t keep up with the pace. Within the first few weeks, I realised there was a vast difference between high school and tertiary programming.</p>

<p>Due to this, I decided to switch majors to mechanical engineering… leaving my dream behind.</p>

<p>After completing my first year of university, I knew mechanical engineering just didn’t feel right for me. I decided to give computing one more shot before I’d truly move on. This time I really took it upon myself to give it everything I had.</p>

<p>The hard work paid off and I had finally passed! I was back on track and set to complete my degree with the major I initally wanted all along.</p>

<p>Since then, I have taught Python and Javascript to other students, joined Dev(){CoP} meetup and more recently graduate with third class honours.</p>

<p>Although this might not be a very inspirational story to most, it has definetly been a rollercoaster for me.</p>

<h3 id="beyond">Beyond</h3>

<p>I realise that I am only at the start of my journey and am excited by the all possibilites this ever-growing field may bring.</p>

<p>I have a lot more to share so do stay tuned!</p>
