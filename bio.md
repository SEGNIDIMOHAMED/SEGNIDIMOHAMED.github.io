:metal: I'm Neil. Software engineer and sometimes writer of my thoughts on things I find interesting.

Quick facts:
* Did almost every role as [Healthtech-1](https://www.healthtech-1.uk)'s founding engineer. Over 1 million patients were registered at 1,000+ NHS GP surgeries using the software in 2 and a half years. I spent a lot of time on fullstack features, built a few algorithms, database management, hiring, cyber security, and the rest.
* Started a [mini deliveroo](https://www.instagram.com/feed.bucks/) in my local town during Covid using Shopify, Facebook ads and a lot of cold calling.
* Occasionally enjoy writing articles like [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/yield-curve-building-in-python-8d7974a6e7e3) or [that](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-cycling-300w-ftp-part-1-2abb04b30036).
* [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](https://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/Edwin_LeFevre_Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator.pdf) made me decide to become a derivatives trader. Did it for 4 years and then left to write software full time.
* :mortar_board: Got a degree in Maths at the University of Warwick ages ago and used to know about approximating integrals using [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12eZWG0Z5gY).
