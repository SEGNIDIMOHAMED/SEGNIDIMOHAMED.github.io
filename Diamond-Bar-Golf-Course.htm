  	<p><a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://diamondbargc.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Diamond Bar Golf Course</a> is an 18 hole par-72 public golf course located in Diamond Bar, California.  It is owned and operated by the <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://parks.lacounty.gov/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>County of Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department</a> .  Daily operations are managed by American Golf.  The course was designed by <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Bell' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>William Francis Bell</a> and opened in 1963. Play is up and over hills with scenic mountain vistas.  The greens are large and undulating.  Fairways are well maintained.  The course is also home to a number of wildlife, including coyotes, deer, rabbits, and hawks.  The Diamond Bar Golf Course is a popular destination for beginning golfers thru to scratch handicaps.  The course is regularly used for Southern California Junior Golf and high school golf tournaments.</p>
	<p>In 2021 the course closed for <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.diamondbarca.gov/968/Golf-Course-Renovation-Project' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>18 months for renovations</a>.  Renovations included the reconfiguring of six holes reducing acreage to 161.9 acres, the installation of new tees and sand traps, a new maintenance facility, and a new irrigation system.  Yardage from the back tees increased by 47 yards to 6,848 yards.  Reconfiguration of six holes: Holes 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 9 would be reconstructed in their entirety with regrassing fairways, new bunkers, and rebuilt tee and green complexess were reconfigured to improve the flow of play and create more challenging and interesting holes.  The source of the renovation is the requirement for <a style='font-weight:bold' href='https://www.diamondbarca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/11191/0323-COG_DBGC_UPDATE?bidId=' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>freeway improvements to the SR-57/SR-60 Confluence Project</a>.  Phase 1 started with installation of new tees and bunkers(sand traps): New tees were installed on all 18 holes.  New bunkers were installed on the renovated six holes.  A new maintenance facility was built to house the course's equipment and taff.  Grassing is Bentgrass Greens, Hybrid Bermuda Tees, Kikuyu Fairways and rough.</p>

		<p>The total cost of the renovation + highway instrastructure project was budgeted at $16.8 million. The project was funded by a combination of county funds and state grants.  Unfortunately, public golf starting times(<b>tee times</b>) have been delayed - The course is reopening in 2024.  For the county, there is a lost green fee component calculated in the renovation net costs.</p>
