        <h1>Renovation - Diamond Bar Golf Course - Municipal Golf in California</h1>
		<p><a href='https://diamondbargc.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>Diamond Bar Golf Course</a> is an 18 hole par-72 public golf course located in Diamond Bar, California.  It is owned and operated by the <a href='https://parks.lacounty.gov/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>County of Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department</a> .  Daily operations are managed by American Golf.  The course was designed by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Bell' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>William Francis Bell</a> and opened in 1963. Play is up and over hills with scenic mountain vistas.  The greens are large and undulating.  Fairways are well-maintained.  The course is also home to a number of wildlife, including coyotes, deer, rabbits, and hawks.  The Diamond Bar Golf Course is a popular destination for beginning golfers thru to scratch handicaps.

		<p>In 2021, the course closed for <a href='https://www.diamondbarca.gov/968/Golf-Course-Renovation-Project' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>18 months for renovations</a>. The renovations included the reconfiguring of six holes, the installation of new tees and sand traps, a new maintenance facility, and a new irrigation system.  Yardage from the back tees increased to 6,848 yards.  Reconfiguration of six holes: The sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 15th, and 16th holes were reconfigured to improve the flow of play and create more challenging and interesting holes.  The source of the renovation is the requirement for <a href='https://www.diamondbarca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/11191/0323-COG_DBGC_UPDATE?bidId=' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>freeway improvements to the SR-57/SR-60 Confluence Project</a>.  Phase 1 started with installation of new tees and bunkers(sand traps): New tees were installed on all 18 holes.  New bunkers were installed on the renovated six holes.  A new maintenance facility was built to house the course's equipment and staff.</p>
		</p>The second phase of the renovation, which was completed in March 2023, included the following:</p>
		<LI>New short game area</LI>
		<LI>New irrigation system: A new irrigation system was installed to improve water efficiency and reduce water usage.</LI>
		<LI>Other improvements: Other improvements included the installation of new signage, the resurfacing of the driving range, and the repair of the cart paths.</LI>

		<p>The total cost of the renovation + highway instrastructure project was budgeted at $16.8 million. The project was funded by a combination of county funds and state grants.  The course is reopening in late 2023 - There is a lost green fee component to the county for the renovation.</p>
