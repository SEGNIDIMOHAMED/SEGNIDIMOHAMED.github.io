title: SANS Summer 2018 Mentor Course
permalink: /sans/
---

I'm hosting a mentor session of the [SANS 504: Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits, and Incident Handling](https://www.sans.org/event/53740). This is a format that allows the full SANS 504 course, but on a slower pace than the firehose of a normal week long SANS course. Each week, you'll have a section of the coursework to read over and study on your own, and then we gather together in a small group (3-5 students) for review and clarification.

At the end, you'll be able to take the [GCIH certification](https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-incident-handler-gcih) at no charge (just be sure to use the code MGIAC18 when you register)

Quick details:
### Who? 
You! (I hope) or other people interested in learning more about incident handling or other defensive techniques
### Where? 
LendingClub in San Francisco
