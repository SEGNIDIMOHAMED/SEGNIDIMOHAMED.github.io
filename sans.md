title: SANS Summer 2018 Mentor Course
permalink: /sans/

~~I'm hosting a mentor session of the [SANS 504: Hacker Tools, Techniques, Exploits, and Incident Handling](https://www.sans.org/event/53740). This is a format that allows the full SANS 504 course, but on a slower pace than the firehose of a normal week long SANS course. Each week, you'll have a section of the coursework to read over and study on your own, and then we gather together in a small group (3-5 students) for review and clarification.~~

~~At the end, you'll be able to take the [GCIH certification](https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-incident-handler-gcih) at no charge (just be sure to use the code MGIAC18 when you register)~~

I hosted the mentor session last summer, and it was fantastic. Much thanks to all my students. I'm planning to do another mentor session in the near future, so stay tuned!
