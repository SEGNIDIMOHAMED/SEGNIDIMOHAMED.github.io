description: My 404 page, featuring a sprawling data centre and a smoking server cabinet, has had some recognition for its design

My [404 page](/404notfound/) — which hopefully you don’t see in normal circumstances — has proved quite popular. 

## The Design

Thinking of 404 page concepts I decided I wanted the design to play up to a computer error theme, with a flavour of the web. 

I settled on the idea of a sprawling data centre and the server that was supposed to be serving your request has gone up in smoke. It just so happens to be server cabinet 404.

Built as an SVG image with a filter effect for the smoke, it also features subtle animation of the server lights blinking and smoke rising, using CSS animation.

## 404 Page Found

In 2014 I posted my page on 404notfound.fr, a new collection of creative error pages, which had just launched. It was accepted and since then it has been accepted to numerous sites with collections of interesting 404 pages, much to my delight.
