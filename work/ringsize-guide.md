### Brief:

Create a downloadable and printable measuring tape for customers to measure themselves and establish their size to assist them in placing jewellery orders.

### Deliverables:

*	Incredibly accurate measurements.
*	Precise instructions and uncluttered design.
*	Sparing use of colour to keep customers print time quick and light on ink use.

The ring size band I designed is as accurate as the tape that Goldsmiths distribute through their website. The measuring band is [still available to download](http://www.idealworld.tv/Jewellery_Size_Guide) to assist customers on the Ideal World site.

<small class="note">I accept no responsibility for the mis-sizing of jewellery due to the download and use of this ring sizing sheet. It is provided as an example of my previous creative work only.</small>
