Print Theme is my first publicly released theme for the Tumblr platform. It draws its inspiration from the CMYK colour blocks you see at the edge of printed material. I thought it would appeal to the creative bias of Tumblr users, and was a feature I had not seen on other themes. 

I noticed that other themes sacrificed quality markup and accessibility for presentation. I ensured the benefits of HTML5 semantic markup, accessibility, international language support and backwards compatibility to older browsers, while putting the content first and allowing theme customisation.

## Theme Features

*	HTML5 semantic markup
*	Typographic grid
*	Custom CSS support
*	Multi-language support
*	@media queries to handle print styles


The theme achieved 200+ installs within its first <time datetime="P7D">7 days</time> available and peaked at **450+ installs**.

For more info about the themes features and customisation options available, see my [Print Theme page](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/printtheme) for more details. I also posted a follow-up of the [theme progress](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/print-theme-update/) and the lessons learned during its development, submission and release. All Print Theme posts are tagged [#printtheme](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/tag/printtheme/).

Print Theme can be found [on the Tumblr Theme Garden](https://www.tumblr.com/theme/30839).

Update: I have [migrated from Tumblr](https://paulfosterdesign.wordpress.com/2016/12/17/paulfosterdesign-on-wordpress-com/) to a WordPress.com blog of the same username.
